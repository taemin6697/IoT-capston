    "text_content": "Yesterday was another long double shift serving at a local restaurant. We get quite a few tourists this time of year but our average customer is pushing probably 60 years old if not even more elderly. It's unfortunately not terribly uncommon to come across poor tippers, you get used to shrugging off the low percentage tips and moving on to the next table. \n\nMy last table of the night (why is it always the last table?), an elderly gentleman and his wife, was fairly quick to order and eat, taking a container for more than half their meals. They shrug off my offer of boxing up any dessert and ask for the bill. I bring their check over which comes to $51 and change. He quickly whips out a wad of cash, hands me $60, and asks for his change in ones. Oh lovely.\n\nI return with his eight crisp dollar bills which he takes and slowly starts placing them at the end of the table one by one. After counting to five he looks up and it comes out... \"there, is that a good tip?\"\n\nWithout even thinking I blurt out, \"no, that's about 10%.. a good tip is fifteen to twenty percent for good service.\" Immediately begin to feel my cheeks blushing but it's too late to take back now. He sheepishly plops the other 3 bills on top as his wife chimes in with, \"well, you asked!\"\n\nOther customers have posed the same question in the past and my typical response would be something along the lines of 'I appreciate whatever you leave for me.' After the long shift I was evidently to the point of brutal honestly and my first reaction was to tell the truth. Maybe he'll even remember and tip more appropriately in the future, but let's not get our hopes up too much.",

We get quite a few tourists this time of year but our average customer is pushing probably 60 years old if not even more elderly. It's unfortunately not terribly uncommon to come across poor tippers, you get used to shrugging off the low percentage tips and moving on to the next table. My last table of the night why is it always the last table? , an elderly gentleman and his wife, was fairly quick to order and eat, taking a container for more than half their meals. They shrug off my offer of boxing up any dessert and ask for the bill. I bring their check over which comes to 51 and change. He quickly whips out a wad of cash, hands me 60, and asks for his change in ones. Oh lovely. I return with his eight crisp dollar bills which he takes and slowly starts placing them at the end of the table one by one. After counting to five he looks up and it comes out... \"there, is that a good tip?\" Without even thinking I blurt out, \"no, that's about 10 .. a good tip is fifteen to twenty percent for good service.\" Immediately begin to feel my cheeks blushing but it's too late to take back now.

After the long shift I was evidently to the point of brutal honestly and my first reaction was to tell the truth. Maybe he'll even remember and tip more appropriately in the future, but let's not get our hopes up too much.\n\n### Video Caption ###\nThe server took the customer's order fairly quickly. They offered to box up dessert, brought the bill, and returned with the correct change. When directly asked by the customer if a specific amount was a good [REMOVED], the server stated that 15-20% is typical for good service.\n\n### User Input ###\n    1.

However, it is difficult to assess the menu explanation based on the caption alone.\n    d) Empathy: 3\n        *   **Justification:** The server provided the necessary service, but based on the limited caption details, it is difficult to judge whether the server remembered customer preferences or offered personalized service. The server provided a factual answer and did not go above and beyond.\n    e) Tangibles: 4\n        *   **Justification:** The caption doesn't provide information on the tangibles. However, it can be assumed that the server's uniform was tidy, and the table settings were clean.\n\n1-2. Video Score Calculation\n    Video Score = (4 + 4 + 3 + 3 + 4) * 4 = 72\n\n5.

Calculate the tip based on the total score and analysis.\n        a) The service level is determined to be Good because the total score is 72, which falls within the Good range for casual dining in the USA (16-20%).\n        b) Given the positive aspects in the video analysis and the restaurant setting, the tip percentage will be within the Good range for the USA in a casual dining setting, which is 15-20%. The server handled all the tasks and gave feedback on the tip. Based on the information, the server provided good service.\n\n        Considering the information, the tip will be set near the middle of the Good range, which is 18%.\n        Tip Amount = $25.00 * 0.18 = $4.50\n        Total Bill = $25.00 + $4.50 = $29.50\n\n7.

I got the drinks, set them down at the table, cleared off another table, and then went back to my lunch; my phone was missing. \n\nI looked around the section, I only had 3 tables, and one of those had just gotten here. One of the tables had a little girl that was trying really hard to avoid my gaze. \n\nI walked over and asked, “I’m sorry to interrupt your lunch, but did you guys see anyone near that table? My phone is missing.” \n\nThe mom said, “No, we didn’t.” \n\nI asked, “Ask you sure your little girl wasn’t playing over there?” \n\nShe’s asked her daughter, who gave a firm “nope”. \n\nI gave an audible “hm”. \n\nThe mom said, “Are you accusing my daughter of stealing? She said no, so that means no, she wasn’t over by your phone that you carelessly left out.” \n\nSo, I pinged my phone with my Apple Watch, and the mom goes, “is that your grandma texting you.”\n\nI pinged again and again and again, and then said, “well whatever the matter is, it must be urgent.” \n\nIt was silent for a few seconds, and I finally said, “give me my phone back, little girl.” She shamefully pulled my phone out of her purse and gave it back to me, the mom somehow looked mortified. \n\n I took my phone and walked away. Needless to say, they left no tip.",

I got the drinks, set them down at the table, cleared off another table, and then went back to my lunch; my phone was missing. I looked around the section, I only had 3 tables, and one of those had just gotten here. One of the tables had a little girl that was trying really hard to avoid my gaze. I walked over and asked, I m sorry to interrupt your lunch, but did you guys see anyone near that table? My phone is missing. The mom said, No, we didn t. I asked, Ask you sure your little girl wasn t playing over there? She s asked her daughter, who gave a firm nope . I gave an audible hm . The mom said, Are you accusing my daughter of stealing? She said no, so that means no, she wasn t over by your phone that you carelessly left out. So, I pinged my phone with my Apple Watch, and the mom goes, is that your grandma texting you. I pinged again and again and again, and then said, well whatever the matter is, it must be urgent. It was silent for a few seconds, and I finally said, give me my phone back, little girl. She shamefully pulled my phone out of her purse and gave it back to me, the mom somehow looked mortified. I took my phone and walked away. Needless to say, they left no tip.\n\n### Video Caption ###\nThe server attended to other tables during their shift by bringing drinks and clearing a table.

Video Evaluation Criteria Analysis**\n\nBased on the description provided in the Reddit post and the video caption, I will evaluate the waiter's performance based on the defined criteria.\n\n*   **a) Reliability:** 1. The waiter's area had an item missing while the waiter was working, indicating a lapse in security or a mistake in oversight. The confrontation also led to recovering the item, demonstrating a lack of security.\n    *Reason: The incident shows that the waiter's area was not reliably secured, and an item went missing. The waiter had to confront a guest to get the item back. This indicates a low level of reliability.*\n*   **b) Responsiveness:** 3. The waiter was responsive to the situation by investigating the missing item, though the delay in finding the item.\n    *Reason: The waiter responded to the missing item by searching for it and questioning the customers.*\n*   **c) Assurance:** 3. The waiter showed the ability to address the issue but the situation may not have had a confident handling\n    *Reason: The waiter handled the situation of the missing item, but there was a lack of confidence.*\n*   **d) Empathy:** 1. The waiter's response to the incident showed very little empathy, only focusing on finding the missing item.\n    *Reason: The scenario doesn't suggest the waiter understood the customer emotions and the whole interaction was negative*\n*   **e) Tangibles:** 4. There is no mention of tangibles, therefore, the score will be neutral.\n    *Reason: The description does not provide any information about the waiter's uniform, cleanliness, or the table's condition.*\n\n**1-2. Video Score Calculation**\n\nVideo Score = (Reliability + Responsiveness + Assurance + Empathy + Tangibles) \\* 4 = (1 + 3 + 3 + 1 + 4) \\* 4 = 48\n\n**5. Total Score**\n\n**5-1. Total Score Calculation**\n\nTotal Score = Video Score = 48\n\n**6. Tip Calculation**\n\n**6-1. Calculate the tip based on the total score and analysis.**\n\n*   Service Level: Based on a score of 48, the service level is classified as Poor.\n*   Tipping Percentage: For casual dining in the USA with Poor service, the range is 0-5%.\n*   Review Content: The incident described in the Reddit post is negative. The waiter's behavior led to the item being stolen.\n*   Final Tip Percentage: Given the negative interaction, a tip of 0% is appropriate.\n\n**6-2.

    "text_content": "This is the first time I’ve ever flat out not tipped in years and it’s a place that came well recommended so I would really appreciate some input as to where I stand. \n\nI went to a restaurant tonight, a big name touristy type place but late at night so it wasn’t very busy. (24 tables, 6 occupied.) \n\nWhen I arrived the hostess was talking to a friend for several minutes before she acknowledged me or anyone in the line that had begun forming behind me. (I know this because when the person she was speaking with left she said, “Sorry, that was just my friend.”) \n\n\nShe asked me if I was the ten top reservation, I said no, I was a two person walk-in. The people behind me identified themselves as the ten person reservation. \n\n\nThey pushed two tables together for the ten top but then seated my party of two at one of the tables and split the group up. I said I was happy to sit elsewhere so the group could sit all together. \n\n\nThey said, pretty aggressively, “We have a system. If you want service then you have to sit where the server put you. You’re not at your house.” I almost left then and there because I was so taken aback by that but wrote it off as stress about the big group coming in. \n\n\nI sat down and asked how many people a medium pizza would feed. My server said he didn’t know. I asked approximately how big it was. He said “medium sized.” \n\n\nWhen the food came it was cold and we hadn’t been given plates or utensils yet. We asked him to take our photo and he said he had a lot to do right now but maybe later. (He was not even close to the only one working.)\n\n\nThe final straw for me was the table next to us pointed out very politely to the server that they’d been given the wrong meal (it contained ground sausage and they’d ordered vegetarian.) Instead of going and fixing it, the server tried to gaslight them saying it *was* what they had ordered. They were visibly clearly Sikh. I am sure they did not order pork. \n\n\nI asked for my check and a box for my food. The server said he’d be right back with my check but it would be about ten minutes for a box. When the check did eventually come it was a table side credit card reader and when I needed to fish in my purse for my card, he did a lot of sighing and made faces. \n\n\nHonestly, I was still planning to leave 10%, but the final incidents with the Sikh diners being served pork and his acting like he was doing us a favor by bringing the check pushed me over the edge. \n\nMaybe I am just venting at this point but I really want to know if I’m missing something. As industry professionals do you see something I did to cause this or a circumstance I might’ve been blind to that caused this? \n\nI feel terribly about the whole thing and could really use some insight. Thank you!!\n\n\nEdit — Sorry I can’t reply to every comment, this got more traction than I was expecting! Thank you for your insight and fun stories. I really appreciate it.",

I went to a restaurant tonight, a big name touristy type place but late at night so it wasn t very busy. 24 tables, 6 occupied. When I arrived the hostess was talking to a friend for several minutes before she acknowledged me or anyone in the line that had begun forming behind me. I know this because when the person she was speaking with left she said, Sorry, that was just my friend. She asked me if I was the ten top reservation, I said no, I was a two person walk in. The people behind me identified themselves as the ten person reservation. They pushed two tables together for the ten top but then seated my party of two at one of the tables and split the group up. I said I was happy to sit elsewhere so the group could sit all together. They said, pretty aggressively, We have a system. If you want service then you have to sit where the server put you. You re not at your house. I almost left then and there because I was so taken aback by that but wrote it off as stress about the big group coming in. I sat down and asked how many people a medium pizza would feed. My server said he didn t know. I asked approximately how big it was. He said medium sized. When the food came it was cold and we hadn t been given plates or utensils yet. We asked him to take our photo and he said he had a lot to do right now but maybe later. He was not even close to the only one working. The final straw for me was the table next to us pointed out very politely to the server that they d been given the wrong meal it contained ground sausage and they d ordered vegetarian. Instead of going and fixing it, the server tried to gaslight them saying it was what they had ordered. They were visibly clearly Sikh. I am sure they did not order pork. I asked for my check and a box for my food. The server said he d be right back with my check but it would be about ten minutes for a box. When the check did eventually come it was a table side credit card reader and when I needed to fish in my purse for my card, he did a lot of sighing and made faces. Honestly, I was still planning to leave 10 , but the final incidents with the Sikh diners being served pork and his acting like he was doing us a favor by bringing the check pushed me over the edge. Maybe I am just venting at this point but I really want to know if I m missing something. As industry professionals do you see something I did to cause this or a circumstance I might ve been blind to that caused this? I feel terribly about the whole thing and could really use some insight. Thank you!! Edit Sorry I can t reply to every comment, this got more traction than I was expecting! Thank you for your insight and fun stories. I really appreciate it.\n\n### Video Caption ###\nThe server lacked menu knowledge and delivered cold food without necessary plates or utensils.

    "title": "\"Well this how we've done it at other restaurants and it always works out.\"",
    "text_content": "I work at a local BBQ joint and we don't do reservations. We have large groups come in all the time and as long as they're okay waiting for tables to clear up then there is usually never an issue. Our sections usually hold up to 30-36 people depending on which one you get.\n\nWell we had a 46 top come in around 3 o'clock one day and they were a softball team with parents and coaches. Since they were such a large group they would have to be in two different sections and have two different servers. So our hostess relayed all of that information to the head of the party and requested that they sit with who will be together on the checks. He just replies \"We just do jersey numbers for checks.\" And then just walked away to sit at the bar and drink water while he waited, which he was told would be close to an hour since we had just filled up for our midday rush. \n\nOur poor 15 year old hostess didn't know what to do so she came to us and told the servers that she didn't think they were going to sit at the same tables. I, luckily, was not gonna be a server for the group and volunteered to go explain the situation better and let them know where they'd be sitting. So I go out to where they're waiting and break it down for them a little better. I even tell them that they're okay sitting at different tables as long as they stay in the same server section. Apparently even that was too much to ask.\n\n\"That just doesn't make sense to us. Why can't we do jersey numbers?\"\n\n\"You can absolutely do numbers, but one server will have 35 of you and then the other 11 will be in a different servers section. So if you have singles or smaller groups they could fit in the 11 and the team can be in the bigger section. That's also the section with the bigger tables so it'd work out perfectly.\"\n\n\"Our kids like to sit together though. And the adults like to sit together too. So we can't do that?\"\n\n\"You're free to spread out however you'd like to in the given sections. It's just gonna get confusing on the servers and if they have people in a different sections than their own. Plus it makes it easier and faster for the kitchen.\" \n\n\"Well this is how we've done it at other restaurants and it always works out. I just don't see why we can't do it how we always do when we go out. It'll be hard for us to figure out where to sit.\"\n\nAt this point, I realized I was just wasting breath. The rest of the group was listening in but I was only really talking to the guy who gave his info for the wait. I really didn't know what else to say without being stern with them so I just told them that this is what would work best for our restaurant and that if they could do as requested by the servers taking care of them that it'd be smooth sailing. Told them I'd check on their wait time and headed back inside. \n\nI go and hunt down the two servers and explain the conversation and told them that I didn't think they'd listen about sitting even in the same sections and to prepare themselves. I don't think either of them were ready for the shitshow that preceded.\n\nIt was an absolute nightmare. Not only did they ignore the sections request but they had somehow grew in size and were now a group of 52. Our hostess had set out menus for the 46 at all the tables for them and yet they spread out in the other servers entire section as well. She at least guided most of them to the correct tables and got menus for the additional six. That was just the easy part. \n\nTheir group was taking up 9-10 tables at this point and the servers are figuring out who's on what check. Like I said they ignored even the request to sit in one section so they were all spread out. One check had 6 people all at different tables and in separate sections. I felt so bad for the servers watching them scramble around between all the tables. And one of our servers, the one with the bigger section, is on her first summer serving so she's still a little green. \n\nI was cut and was finishing my side work when they started getting their food. It apparently took another hour and a half for everyone to get their food out. And one server was ringing in food for over 20 minutes because of the way the checks were split.They were complaining that other tables were getting food before they all got their food. Server had to explain that orders from those other tables were still being rung in between their food orders as well. They didn't like that answer and demanded that their food come out next. Our kitchen does their tickets in order so not much we can do if your food isn't up next and not even made yet.\n\nIt was all around terrible for the servers and expos who brought out the food. And I'm guessing they didn't have a good time either because not one person tipped 20 percent and 5 of the checks didn't tip at all. And of course we don't do auto gratuity so one server owed money after tip outs for their checks. \n\nOverall just don't understand why people can't sit with who they're paying for. Especially with a group that size. I understand wanting to socialize but they didn't even try to make it easy. I'm from a fairly large family and whenever we go out it's usually always separate checks. Only a couple times will we be at seperate tables and at that point somebody just orders for who they have on their check to make it easy. \n\nSorry for the long post. Curious to see if others have the same problem. It's seems(to me, at least) like it's always softball/baseball teams that are the ones that have more of an issue with this and it's not too hard if they're only split between two or three tables but when it's a whole section it just gets messy.\n\nTL:DR  46 top comes into restaurant. Refuses to sit with checks after being asked, even within the same servers section. Becomes a 52 top. Upset that food came out at different times and tipped poorly.",

We have large groups come in all the time and as long as they're okay waiting for tables to clear up then there is usually never an issue. Our sections usually hold up to 30 36 people depending on which one you get. Well we had a 46 top come in around 3 o'clock one day and they were a softball team with parents and coaches. Since they were such a large group they would have to be in two different sections and have two different servers. So our hostess relayed all of that information to the head of the party and requested that they sit with who will be together on the checks. He just replies \"We just do jersey numbers for checks.\" And then just walked away to sit at the bar and drink water while he waited, which he was told would be close to an hour since we had just filled up for our midday rush. Our poor 15 year old hostess didn't know what to do so she came to us and told the servers that she didn't think they were going to sit at the same tables. I, luckily, was not gonna be a server for the group and volunteered to go explain the situation better and let them know where they'd be sitting. So I go out to where they're waiting and break it down for them a little better. I even tell them that they're okay sitting at different tables as long as they stay in the same server section. Apparently even that was too much to ask. \"That just doesn't make sense to us. Why can't we do jersey numbers?\" \"You can absolutely do numbers, but one server will have 35 of you and then the other 11 will be in a different servers section. So if you have singles or smaller groups they could fit in the 11 and the team can be in the bigger section. That's also the section with the bigger tables so it'd work out perfectly.\" \"Our kids like to sit together though. And the adults like to sit together too. So we can't do that?\" \"You're free to spread out however you'd like to in the given sections. It's just gonna get confusing on the servers and if they have people in a different sections than their own. Plus it makes it easier and faster for the kitchen.\" \"Well this is how we've done it at other restaurants and it always works out. I just don't see why we can't do it how we always do when we go out. It'll be hard for us to figure out where to sit.\" At this point, I realized I was just wasting breath. The rest of the group was listening in but I was only really talking to the guy who gave his info for the wait. I really didn't know what else to say without being stern with them so I just told them that this is what would work best for our restaurant and that if they could do as requested by the servers taking care of them that it'd be smooth sailing. Told them I'd check on their wait time and headed back inside. I go and hunt down the two servers and explain the conversation and told them that I didn't think they'd listen about sitting even in the same sections and to prepare themselves. I don't think either of them were ready for the shitshow that preceded. It was an absolute nightmare. Not only did they ignore the sections request but they had somehow grew in size and were now a group of 52. Our hostess had set out menus for the 46 at all the tables for them and yet they spread out in the other servers entire section as well. She at least guided most of them to the correct tables and got menus for the additional six. That was just the easy part. Their group was taking up 9 10 tables at this point and the servers are figuring out who's on what check. Like I said they ignored even the request to sit in one section so they were all spread out. One check had 6 people all at different tables and in separate sections. I felt so bad for the servers watching them scramble around between all the tables. And one of our servers, the one with the bigger section, is on her first summer serving so she's still a little green. I was cut and was finishing my side work when they started getting their food. It apparently took another hour and a half for everyone to get their food out. And one server was ringing in food for over 20 minutes because of the way the checks were split.They were complaining that other tables were getting food before they all got their food. Server had to explain that orders from those other tables were still being rung in between their food orders as well. They didn't like that answer and demanded that their food come out next. Our kitchen does their tickets in order so not much we can do if your food isn't up next and not even made yet. It was all around terrible for the servers and expos who brought out the food. And I'm guessing they didn't have a good time either because not one person tipped 20 percent and 5 of the checks didn't tip at all. And of course we don't do auto gratuity so one server owed money after tip outs for their checks. Overall just don't understand why people can't sit with who they're paying for. Especially with a group that size. I understand wanting to socialize but they didn't even try to make it easy. I'm from a fairly large family and whenever we go out it's usually always separate checks. Only a couple times will we be at seperate tables and at that point somebody just orders for who they have on their check to make it easy. Sorry for the long post. Curious to see if others have the same problem. It's seems to me, at least like it's always softball baseball teams that are the ones that have more of an issue with this and it's not too hard if they're only split between two or three tables but when it's a whole section it just gets messy. TL:DR 46 top comes into restaurant. Refuses to sit with checks after being asked, even within the same servers section. Becomes a 52 top. Upset that food came out at different times and tipped poorly.\n\n### Video Caption ###\nServers were assigned to a large group (52 people) that disregarded seating requests, spreading across multiple tables and sections. They struggled with complex check splitting and spent significant time ringing in orders due to the group's methods.

Video Evaluation Criteria**\n\n*   **a) Reliability: 1**  The servers clearly experienced numerous issues stemming from the customers' behavior. Orders were likely delayed and possibly incorrect due to the complex check splitting and seating arrangements. The long wait times for food to arrive also suggest potential kitchen errors and order inaccuracies.\n*   **b) Responsiveness: 3**  The servers were placed in a very difficult situation. While they were likely responsive to the group's needs, they were severely hampered by the group's lack of cooperation. The text mentions servers explaining delays, indicating they were attempting to communicate. However, due to the circumstances the response was average.\n*   **c) Assurance: 3** The servers likely tried to explain the situation and the kitchen's processes, but they likely lacked confidence in a situation where the customers were being difficult.\n*   **d) Empathy: 3** The servers likely showed basic friendliness, but given the stress and complications caused by the group, it's difficult to imagine them offering personalized service or proactively understanding the customers' emotions.\n*   **e) Tangibles: 5** This is difficult to assess from the given information, but the information provided gives no indication of tangibles being dirty or subpar.\n\n**1-2.

Even after getting their food, I'm still being ran to death and this whole ordeal takes 2 and half hours of my remaining shift. Intitally the ticket was all one, then it's decided it'll be split different ways of course! My other tables stiffed me, and with an overall bill of 400, I prayed this 30 top is worth my time. They left 30 dollars altogether . My section is a mess now, my time wasted, and I just want to cry. These folks acted like they were the only ones in the restaurant, ran me to fucking death, took up the last two hours of my shift, and ruined my chances of actually making some money. Denny's can fuck off with that no automatic gratuity. Made 78 dollars. I'm still so fucking pissed off.\n\n### Video Caption ###\nThe server was overwhelmed while managing a large party that unexpectedly grew to 30 people and several other tables. This resulted in the server struggling to provide timely refills and attend to guest requests for the large party.

    "response": "Okay, I will analyze the Reddit post, evaluate the video based on the provided criteria, and calculate the appropriate tip.\n\n### Analysis of the Reddit Post and Video\nThe Reddit post paints a clear picture of a disastrous service experience. The server was clearly overwhelmed due to an unexpectedly large party (30 people instead of the expected 15). This resulted in significant delays, neglected service for other tables, and overall poor customer satisfaction. The video caption summarizes this situation accurately, highlighting the server's struggles with refills, order accuracy, and attending to all customers.\n\n### 1-1. Video Evaluation Criteria\n\n*   **a) Reliability:** 1 - The post indicates order inaccuracies (\"godforbid its in the order I sent it\") and significant delays. The large party's order was clearly difficult to manage, leading to mistakes or at least the appearance of mistakes in food delivery.\n    *   *Justification:* The server struggled to manage the large party and multiple tables, leading to likely errors and a lack of timely delivery of food.\n*   **b) Responsiveness:** 2 - The server was likely unable to respond quickly due to being overwhelmed by the large party. Other tables were neglected.\n    *   *Justification:* The server was understaffed and overwhelmed.\n*   **c) Assurance:** 2 - The server likely struggled to provide confident and helpful service given the chaotic situation. It's unlikely they could offer menu suggestions or build customer trust.\n    *   *Justification:* Given the extreme pressure, it's unlikely the server could provide professional and confident service.\n*   **d) Empathy:** 2 - While the server was likely polite, the situation prevented personalized service or proactive understanding of customer emotions.\n    *   *Justification:* The sheer volume of customers would have made it hard to provide personalized or empathetic service.\n*   **e) Tangibles:** 3 - There's no direct information about tangibles in the Reddit post, but given the level of stress and the number of tables, it is assumed that the server could maintain an acceptable level of cleanliness.\n    *   *Justification:* The post does not contain information on this topic.\n\n### 1-2.

    "text_content": "Hello reddit! I'm a cashier at a small store and also work as a writer. I know, hard to absorb but I have to put food on the table too. Anyway, I just wanted to post this because this waitress really made my day. \n\nSo, I get up around seven o'clock in the morning. Go, do my writing for the day. Try to sleep in a bit. Go into work. I have a long, hard day of work. Since it's the beginning of the month it's very, VERY busy. People were generally....okay. But afterwards I felt hungover and tired. I had promised my boyfriend we would go out later tonight since he and I had been stuck in the house all week. \n\nSo we go out to TGI Fridays. Now, the one in particular near me used to have really nasty waitresses. I mean, the meanest people around. I had work their previously for three weeks a couple of years ago myself. One of the waitresses was very nasty to me (for no reason what so ever) and afterwards I got fired for not being able to keep up. I handled it professionally, but anyway on with the story. \n\nSo once we get there I'm pretty tired. Me and my boyfriend start talking. We decide to only order the endless Apps, but see here's the catch. You can only have the endless apps of one appetizer. Yep. You heard me right. So you can have endless wings, potato skins, etc. \n\nWe ordered that and my boyfriend ordered a burger. As we were eating this waitress comes up I've never seen before. The entire time we're there she explained fully to us the best food available there. Helped out make our decisions on what to get (I was pretty out of it from work so I know I was probably like a zombie) but the entire time this woman has the biggest smile on her face. It was so genuine I even found myself smiling back at her. \n\nSo, towards the end of the night she offered to box us some of the wings I had ordered. My boyfriend mentioned she may have tricked us and charged us extra for it. Since in the endless apps you CANNOT take any of it home with you. House rules. I was going to say something, but I was to tired to care. I told him not worry about it since I was the one paying. (It was my turn to treat and I was pretty adamant with my boyfriend we needed to start taking turns paying for stuff.)\n\nSo she comes back with a box. The hot wings were served to us by another waitress, and at first we were confused. Then she says the coolest thing I've ever heard.\n\n\"Sorry, I have to trick the system. Do you mind if I use your celery as a spoon to get these in here?\" She pointed at the hot wings we had just been brought and the box. I was stunned, then smiled and said sure. \n\nSo she gave us a whole plate of hot wings. Along with dumping our Parmesan wings into the same box. On TOP of that she also made sure we had plenty of ranch to take home with us in a little container. Then just as I ask for the bills she says this,\n\n\"Do you want a soda to go too?\" I was stunned. I really wasn't used to this kind of service. We hadn't even ordered that much. Our bill came around to roughly $30, and while we technically should have been charged more she deducted the \"extra\" wings we were taking out. \n\nThis entire time while waiting on us she also continued to check up on us. Constantly made sure my drink was full, and just very kind all around to me and my boyfriend. After having a hard day at work I was very happy. I even told her about having previously worked there and how she was the nicest waitress I'd ever met. The entire time she also kept saying how much she loved her job and explaining things to people. \n\nI wanted to leave her a decent tip, so I gave $6 for the tip. I wish I could have given her more, but at that point I was down to $50 and I have a few other things I have to pay for tomorrow when I get the paycheck from my retail job. \n\nStill, she really made my day. Woke up crummy, went to work crummy, came home crummy, go out, and come back happy. Even my boyfriend was pretty happy and if it wasn't for her I don't think we would have had such a good time going out. \n\nI have a lot of respect for anyone who has to work as a server, waiter, or waitress. Even though I only did the job myself for three weeks I know how hard it can be. So kudos to awesome people like you and also to super nice retail workers! Keep up the good work, and I hope one day I'm in a position to tip bigger!\n\nP.S. Was $6 enough of a tip? I felt like I didn't tip her enough, but I really couldn't spare anymore money. ;-;",

I'm a cashier at a small store and also work as a writer. I know, hard to absorb but I have to put food on the table too. Anyway, I just wanted to post this because this waitress really made my day. So, I get up around seven o'clock in the morning. Go, do my writing for the day. Try to sleep in a bit. Go into work. I have a long, hard day of work. Since it's the beginning of the month it's very, VERY busy. People were generally....okay. But afterwards I felt hungover and tired. I had promised my boyfriend we would go out later tonight since he and I had been stuck in the house all week. So we go out to TGI Fridays. Now, the one in particular near me used to have really nasty waitresses. I mean, the meanest people around. I had work their previously for three weeks a couple of years ago myself. One of the waitresses was very nasty to me for no reason what so ever and afterwards I got fired for not being able to keep up. I handled it professionally, but anyway on with the story. So once we get there I'm pretty tired. Me and my boyfriend start talking. We decide to only order the endless Apps, but see here's the catch. You can only have the endless apps of one appetizer. Yep. You heard me right. So you can have endless wings, potato skins, etc. We ordered that and my boyfriend ordered a burger. As we were eating this waitress comes up I've never seen before. The entire time we're there she explained fully to us the best food available there. Helped out make our decisions on what to get I was pretty out of it from work so I know I was probably like a zombie but the entire time this woman has the biggest smile on her face. It was so genuine I even found myself smiling back at her. So, towards the end of the night she offered to box us some of the wings I had ordered. My boyfriend mentioned she may have tricked us and charged us extra for it. Since in the endless apps you CANNOT take any of it home with you. House rules. I was going to say something, but I was to tired to care. I told him not worry about it since I was the one paying. It was my turn to treat and I was pretty adamant with my boyfriend we needed to start taking turns paying for stuff. So she comes back with a box. The hot wings were served to us by another waitress, and at first we were confused. Then she says the coolest thing I've ever heard. \"Sorry, I have to trick the system. Do you mind if I use your celery as a spoon to get these in here?\" She pointed at the hot wings we had just been brought and the box. I was stunned, then smiled and said sure. So she gave us a whole plate of hot wings. Along with dumping our Parmesan wings into the same box. On TOP of that she also made sure we had plenty of ranch to take home with us in a little container. Then just as I ask for the bills she says this, \"Do you want a soda to go too?\" I was stunned. I really wasn't used to this kind of service. We hadn't even ordered that much. Our bill came around to roughly 30, and while we technically should have been charged more she deducted the \"extra\" wings we were taking out. This entire time while waiting on us she also continued to check up on us. Constantly made sure my drink was full, and just very kind all around to me and my boyfriend. After having a hard day at work I was very happy. I even told her about having previously worked there and how she was the nicest waitress I'd ever met. The entire time she also kept saying how much she loved her job and explaining things to people. I wanted to leave her a decent tip, so I gave 6 for the tip. I wish I could have given her more, but at that point I was down to 50 and I have a few other things I have to pay for tomorrow when I get the paycheck from my retail job. Still, she really made my day. Woke up crummy, went to work crummy, came home crummy, go out, and come back happy. Even my boyfriend was pretty happy and if it wasn't for her I don't think we would have had such a good time going out. I have a lot of respect for anyone who has to work as a server, waiter, or waitress. Even though I only did the job myself for three weeks I know how hard it can be. So kudos to awesome people like you and also to super nice retail workers! Keep up the good work, and I hope one day I'm in a position to tip bigger! P.S. Was 6 enough of a tip? I felt like I didn't tip her enough, but I really couldn't spare anymore money. ; ;\n\n### Video Caption ###\nThe waitress provided attentive service, frequently checking on the table and ensuring drinks were full.

    "text_content": "I have only been a server for 3 months and have been working at one chain brand, and recently transferred to another location across town.\n\nWe have this family (adults and children of all ages 4-8 ppl) that comes in a few times a month. At the old location, they were well know for not tipping. One night, I was the lucky server who’s section they were in. I did everything with a smile, fixed all their orders they never customized in the first place, refills, sauces, choosing new drinks half way through, this that, kids, the mess. Split their bills. Got a $0 tip for almost 2 hours worth of work and cleanup.\n\nWell, they now frequent this second location too. They have the same notorious no tipping agenda with full force run down the waitress for fun mentality. I looked at them get seating in my section, on a super busy night, and made a choice I am proud of to this day, I decided I wasn’t going to let them get under my skin. Not even close. You will have what you pay for, which was also every cent I could charge for every sauce and soda brand switch they requested. \n\nFirst, I gave them about 10 minutes to get seated and think about being thirsty as they watch me serve beverages to my full 6 table section. I go over once and write a beverage down for everyone and bring it out, don’t drink it too fast now bc that is all I am bringing out tonight. I go around a take everyone else’s orders, key them into the most visible computer and then proceed to take their orders last and nail every accommodation and sauce charge they ask for and walk to the furthest computer. One lady wants her food made at the end to go. I will gladly make it with the rest of the food and let it sit under the lamp until you are ready to leave. Seeing you are not tipping, I will allow the food runner to serve your meal. Oh you need extra sauce you didn’t order? Well so do 5 other tables so you can watch their sauces come first. Then I will ask what sauce it was you needed again. Oh you say refills? Give me a few moments to find that warm pitcher of tea sitting on the ledge. Hope it’s fully enough bc I am splitting between you all, not refilling it. By this time, I am being tipped out by other tables as they are asking for the checks. No tips from this family, as expected and deserved. But one lady did apologize for her sisters rudeness, and that was good enough bc the sister heard.\n\nNow, because I dearly remember you, I hope that you remember me now too. Remember that I have served you great, and remember when you didn’t pay for that service like others in my section have, you will only get exactly what you pay for. Sit somewhere else, or pay for what you want. \n\nAlso to note, I was never without a smile or kindness in my voice, I just for some reason kept forgetting about this table, like they were camouflage or something.

We have this family adults and children of all ages 4 8 ppl that comes in a few times a month. At the old location, they were well know for not tipping. One night, I was the lucky server who s section they were in. I did everything with a smile, fixed all their orders they never customized in the first place, refills, sauces, choosing new drinks half way through, this that, kids, the mess. Split their bills. Got a 0 tip for almost 2 hours worth of work and cleanup. Well, they now frequent this second location too. They have the same notorious no tipping agenda with full force run down the waitress for fun mentality. I looked at them get seating in my section, on a super busy night, and made a choice I am proud of to this day, I decided I wasn t going to let them get under my skin. Not even close. You will have what you pay for, which was also every cent I could charge for every sauce and soda brand switch they requested. First, I gave them about 10 minutes to get seated and think about being thirsty as they watch me serve beverages to my full 6 table section. I go over once and write a beverage down for everyone and bring it out, don t drink it too fast now bc that is all I am bringing out tonight. I go around a take everyone else s orders, key them into the most visible computer and then proceed to take their orders last and nail every accommodation and sauce charge they ask for and walk to the furthest computer. One lady wants her food made at the end to go. I will gladly make it with the rest of the food and let it sit under the lamp until you are ready to leave. Seeing you are not tipping, I will allow the food runner to serve your meal. Oh you need extra sauce you didn t order? Well so do 5 other tables so you can watch their sauces come first. Then I will ask what sauce it was you needed again. Oh you say refills? Give me a few moments to find that warm pitcher of tea sitting on the ledge. Hope it s fully enough bc I am splitting between you all, not refilling it. By this time, I am being tipped out by other tables as they are asking for the checks. No tips from this family, as expected and deserved. But one lady did apologize for her sisters rudeness, and that was good enough bc the sister heard. Now, because I dearly remember you, I hope that you remember me now too. Remember that I have served you great, and remember when you didn t pay for that service like others in my section have, you will only get exactly what you pay for. Sit somewhere else, or pay for what you want. Also to note, I was never without a smile or kindness in my voice, I just for some reason kept forgetting about this table, like they were camouflage or something. Hmm?\n\n### Video Caption ###\nThe server intentionally delayed taking the table's order, bringing drinks (providing only one initially per person), bringing refills (splitting a warm pitcher), and bringing extra sauces. Food delivery was delegated to a food runner, and a to-go order was left under a heat lamp from initial preparation. Despite these intentional delays and limitations, the server maintained a smile and kind tone.\n\n### User Input ###\n    1. Country: USA, Type: Casual dining\n    2.

Video Evaluation Criteria\n\n*   **a) Reliability: 2** The server intentionally limited service, such as delaying refills and extra sauces. Orders were technically fulfilled, but the focus was on fulfilling the minimum requirements, not providing a positive experience. Billing accuracy isn't directly mentioned in the video caption, but given the context of the server's actions, it's unlikely there were errors.\n*   **b) Responsiveness: 2** While the server maintained a smile and a kind tone, the video caption highlights delays in service. Refills were slow, extra sauces were delayed, and the overall pace of service was intentionally slowed down.\n*   **c) Assurance: 3** The server fulfilled the orders as requested and did so with a pleasant demeanor, demonstrating a degree of competence. However, the actions taken demonstrate a lack of confidence in providing a superior level of service.\n*   **d) Empathy: 1** The server showed no empathy for this customer. The actions taken suggest that the server was prioritizing the other patrons in the section over this specific customer. There was no attempt to understand or address the customers' needs beyond the bare minimum.\n*   **e) Tangibles: 5** The cleanliness of the table and uniform is not mentioned in the context. Given that the user specified a chain brand, the restaurant likely has a ServSafe certification level cleanliness.\n\n1-2.

Its kinda hard to fuck up a pizza unless its over/under-cooked or doesn't have enough toppings, etc. It looked damn fine to me. Secondly, the beer he's obsessed about is local.

    "text_content": "To start off, this was a few years ago as Bar Manager at a 5 Star Hotel Bar in Sydney, Australia. We were located in the CBD area and were patronised by mostly Politicians and Lawyer types. Also I’m on mobile so please forgive the formatting. \n\nIt’s a quiet day, a group of three walks in, directly after a rush. One male, pushing 50 and two younger woman in their 20’s. \n\nWe have a sign that asks, please wait to be seated, but of course being so important he brushes past the section waiter and sits at a table laden with dishes from a High Tea we had just hosted for 8 guests. \n\nSnaps his fingers at his waiter to ‘clean this up’ and bring some menus. The waiter flags me down to help clean the table as there was a lot of things to clear of various sizes and shapes of course, not to mention the 3 tier stands which are a one per hand scenario. \n\nHis two guests kept saying thank you and asking if we wanted them to shift to a smaller table. The man interjected and said not to worry as we had mostly emptied out by this point. Although there were other small table configurations ready to go, including a booth by the window. I asked if they wanted a window table at all and the fellow goes: Why, so we can fucking look at the street we work on all day? I said of course sir, we won’t be a moment making the table ready. I got the vibe the ladies were a bit uncomfortable at this point. \n\nWhile we are sorting this out, he starts asking me about the wine selection. After asking a few questions regarding his preferences, I ran down a few suitable options for him. At this point he looks over at his lovely guests and says “oh what a surprise, he knows his wine”. After dealing with assholes like this all my life, I’m pretty much Teflon. So I made a joke and said “only cause I drink so much wine” to cut the tension and allow his to save some face. \n\nThe wine comes out, he makes a big show of the tasting, using the limited vocabulary he knows to impress his guests. They then order entrees (him - French onion soup and the ladies- seared tuna Niçoise salads and a main each. When I’m doing the quality checks on the entrees he decides to complain on behalf of his guests.  The seared tuna on the Niçoise salad looks raw in the middle. I tried to explain to him the preparation method but he said it should be cooked through. I offered the ladies to try something else but they both declined. Saying they were enjoying the salads. \n\nHe mentioned he was just giving feedback and was going to pay for it anyway as he didn’t need anything for free. But just mention it to the Chefs for next time. I of course said I would pass it on and we would take them off the check as I eye rolled my way all the way back to the kitchen. Ya know, to pretend I was going to tell our Chefs how to sear tuna. \n\nNow, for my pettiness. He flags me down to finalise the check. I drop off his bill containing two bottles of Kiwi Sauv Blanc(fairly cheap in Australia) , One entree and three mains. The bill is maybe $200AUD. \n\nI pick up a mobile eftpos terminal and go over to the table to collect the check. I can see he has specifically written $0.00 In the tip column. \n\nHe brings out the corporate card, company name, his name etc. Now if ever a card declines the terminals give us an error code such as wrong account, wrong pin, insufficient funds etc. if it’s ever the later, I try to make sure I say it, without saying it. Such as “do you want to try another card for instance. Cause otherwise it’s awkward as hell. \n\nHe was chatting up the ladies when I loudly said, IM SORRY SIR, YOUR CARD HAS INSUFFICIENT FUNDS”.

We were located in the CBD area and were patronised by mostly Politicians and Lawyer types. Also I m on mobile so please forgive the formatting. It s a quiet day, a group of three walks in, directly after a rush. One male, pushing 50 and two younger woman in their 20 s. We have a sign that asks, please wait to be seated, but of course being so important he brushes past the section waiter and sits at a table laden with dishes from a High Tea we had just hosted for 8 guests. Snaps his fingers at his waiter to clean this up and bring some menus. The waiter flags me down to help clean the table as there was a lot of things to clear of various sizes and shapes of course, not to mention the 3 tier stands which are a one per hand scenario. His two guests kept saying thank you and asking if we wanted them to shift to a smaller table. The man interjected and said not to worry as we had mostly emptied out by this point. Although there were other small table configurations ready to go, including a booth by the window. I asked if they wanted a window table at all and the fellow goes: Why, so we can fucking look at the street we work on all day? I said of course sir, we won t be a moment making the table ready. I got the vibe the ladies were a bit uncomfortable at this point. While we are sorting this out, he starts asking me about the wine selection. After asking a few questions regarding his preferences, I ran down a few suitable options for him. At this point he looks over at his lovely guests and says oh what a surprise, he knows his wine . After dealing with assholes like this all my life, I m pretty much Teflon. So I made a joke and said only cause I drink so much wine to cut the tension and allow his to save some face. The wine comes out, he makes a big show of the tasting, using the limited vocabulary he knows to impress his guests. They then order entrees him French onion soup and the ladies seared tuna Niçoise salads and a main each. When I m doing the quality checks on the entrees he decides to complain on behalf of his guests. The seared tuna on the Niçoise salad looks raw in the middle. I tried to explain to him the preparation method but he said it should be cooked through. I offered the ladies to try something else but they both declined. Saying they were enjoying the salads. He mentioned he was just giving feedback and was going to pay for it anyway as he didn t need anything for free. But just mention it to the Chefs for next time. I of course said I would pass it on and we would take them off the check as I eye rolled my way all the way back to the kitchen. Ya know, to pretend I was going to tell our Chefs how to sear tuna. Now, for my pettiness. He flags me down to finalise the check. I drop off his bill containing two bottles of Kiwi Sauv Blanc fairly cheap in Australia , One entree and three mains. The bill is maybe 200AUD. I pick up a mobile eftpos terminal and go over to the table to collect the check. I can see he has specifically written 0.00 In the tip column. He brings out the corporate card, company name, his name etc. Now if ever a card declines the terminals give us an error code such as wrong account, wrong pin, insufficient funds etc. if it s ever the later, I try to make sure I say it, without saying it. Such as do you want to try another card for instance. Cause otherwise it s awkward as hell. He was chatting up the ladies when I loudly said, IM SORRY SIR, YOUR CARD HAS INSUFFICIENT FUNDS . This stopped the converstion and he fumbled around and said oh some name in accounts hasn t paid my Bill for the month. I ll get that sorted. Just take my personal card . By this point his tone had changed and he was being a bit softer with me. I swipe his personal card, Thank you Server Gods for this delicious moment... I interrupt him again, a little quieter this time. I m sorry sir, this card has insufficient funds also. At this point, both of the ladies offered to pay the bill over his protests. Even negotiating paying half each. He would have none of it. He made us all wait, while he jumped onto his banking app, to transfer the required amount to his personal card. The ladies were giving each other looks. The ladies took that time to thank us for the service and the meal. The man looked absolutely defeated by this point. Through some misplaced shame he decided to shake my hand as they left to say thank you. Like being nice all of a sudden would make everyone else forget he was a jerk. It was small. It was petty. But it felt like victory to me.\n\n### Video Caption ###\nThe service included clearing a heavily laden table, offering alternative seating, and demonstrating wine knowledge.

Video Evaluation Criteria\n\na) Reliability: Score 3\n    *   **Reason:** The caption mentions the server refills drinks and pre-busses. These actions are generally reliable. However, there's no mention of order accuracy, so it's difficult to assess reliability in terms of order-taking. The score is set to a moderate level.\n\nb) Responsiveness: Score 4\n    *   **Reason:** The caption implies attentive service through pre-bussing and drink refills. While not explicitly stated, these actions suggest a degree of responsiveness. Therefore, the score is set to 4 (Quick and polite responses), as it is a base estimation through the provided caption.\n\nc) Assurance: Score 3\n    *   **Reason:** The caption does not provide enough information on the server's ability to explain the menu or handle customer concerns with confidence. Thus, the score is set to 3 (Can explain the menu but lacks confidence) as there is no information.\n\nd) Empathy: Score 3\n    *   **Reason:** The caption mentions pre-bussing and drink refills; however, there is no information about personalized service or proactive understanding of customer emotions. Thus, the score is set to 3 (Basic friendliness but lacks personalization).\n\ne) Tangibles: Score 4\n    *   **Reason:** The caption does not provide information about the tangible aspects of the service. However, the server is presumably meeting basic cleanliness standards. Thus, the score is set to 4 (Uniform and table settings are tidy, cleanliness maintained) for the estimation.\n\n1-2.

Calculate the tip based on the total score and analysis.\n    *   Service Level: The total score is 68, which falls within the \"Normal\" range for casual dining in the USA (6-15%).\n    *   Tipping Percentage: Based on the \"Normal\" service level in the USA for casual dining, the base tip range is 6-15%. The server feels they offer exceptional service.\n\n    Since the server felt they performed exceptional service, I will adjust the tip towards the upper end of the normal range.\n\n    The video shows pre-bussing and drink refills, and the user feels they provide exceptional service.\n    Tipping percentage = 15%\n    Tip amount = $25.00 * 15% = $3.75\n    Total bill = $25.00 + $3.75 = $28.75\n\n    6-2.

    "text_content": "I used to serve at an Asian fusion restaurant in Naples Fl that closed about a year ago. The demographics of Naples is largely elderly folk who have second homes here. Working lunches there were very hectic sometimes because I was the only server most of the times and there wasn’t a food runner/busser/hostess or bartender. The restaurant was in a good location and it was a very big restaurant. Sometimes it would get so busy, I’d literally have to run to go run food or run to go make drinks. Sometimes I’d be taking care of close to 20 tables all at the same time. Anyways, we had this one older lady who was a regular. She said she had some immune system problem and demanded a bowl of hot water to clean her silverware the moment she sat down. She claimed she had diabetes and would hound me to get her food as soon as possible no matter how many food tickets were ahead of hers or how busy I was. She would never leave anything more than 20% despite being so needy and demanding. She was one of my least favorite customers of all time. Most people were very nice to me and even impressed seeing how I handled that many tables with no help. A lot of times it led to good tips or people being very patient. She would come eat at the restaurant very soon after Covid with her mask and I’m thinking why are you out here eating at a busy restaurant if you’re this old, immune system problems, diabetes and you’re scared of Covid? It honestly felt like she just wanted to give me problems, I wonder if she would do that to other servers at different restaurants or just mine because we accommodated her insane needs. Just wanted to share this story about one of least favorite customers of all time. ",

The demographics of Naples is largely elderly folk who have second homes here. Working lunches there were very hectic sometimes because I was the only server most of the times and there wasn t a food runner busser hostess or bartender. The restaurant was in a good location and it was a very big restaurant. Sometimes it would get so busy, I d literally have to run to go run food or run to go make drinks. Sometimes I d be taking care of close to 20 tables all at the same time. Anyways, we had this one older lady who was a regular. She said she had some immune system problem and demanded a bowl of hot water to clean her silverware the moment she sat down. She claimed she had diabetes and would hound me to get her food as soon as possible no matter how many food tickets were ahead of hers or how busy I was. She would never leave anything more than 20 despite being so needy and demanding. She was one of my least favorite customers of all time. Most people were very nice to me and even impressed seeing how I handled that many tables with no help. A lot of times it led to good tips or people being very patient. She would come eat at the restaurant very soon after Covid with her mask and I m thinking why are you out here eating at a busy restaurant if you re this old, immune system problems, diabetes and you re scared of Covid? It honestly felt like she just wanted to give me problems, I wonder if she would do that to other servers at different restaurants or just mine because we accommodated her insane needs. Just wanted to share this story about one of least favorite customers of all time.\n\n### Video Caption ###\nThe server accommodated the customer's specific requests by providing a bowl of hot water immediately upon seating. The server also attempted to prioritize the customer's food order despite the restaurant being busy and having a queue of tickets. The server managed a large section of tables alone during busy periods.\n\n### User Input ###\n    1. Country: USA, Type: Casual dining\n    2. Restaurant name: Gold Spoon\n    3. Calculated subtotal: $25.00\n",
    "response": "Okay, I will analyze the provided information and calculate the appropriate tip.\n\n### Analysis of the Video\n\nThe video caption highlights the server's actions. Here's the breakdown of the evaluation criteria:\n\n1-1. Video Evaluation Criteria\n\n   *   **a) Reliability:** 3 - Mostly accurate orders, occasional lack of confirmation. The server appears to attempt to meet the customer's needs, which suggests a degree of reliability in fulfilling requests. However, the context also implies potential prioritization issues due to the customer's demands during a busy service.\n   *   **b) Responsiveness:** 4 - Quick and polite responses. The server's actions of accommodating requests are prompt and considerate, even when handling a large number of tables, suggesting good responsiveness.\n   *   **c) Assurance:** 3 - Can explain the menu but lacks confidence. The video itself doesn't provide information about the server's menu knowledge. However, the server's behavior indicates politeness and willingness to help but there is no information about the server having confidence in their actions.\n   *   **d) Empathy:** 3 - Basic friendliness but lacks personalization. The server is seen accommodating a customer's needs, suggesting a baseline level of empathy. However, the customer is viewed as \"needy and demanding\" and there is no information about offering personalized services.\n   *   **e) Tangibles:** 4 - Uniform and table settings are tidy, cleanliness maintained. The video description does not give specific details on tangibles, but it can be inferred that the place has been accommodated with necessary needs.\n\n1-2. Video Score Calculation\n    Video Score = (3 + 4 + 3 + 3 + 4) * 4 = 68\n\n5.  Total Score\n    5-1. Total Score Calculation\n        Total Score = Video Score = 68\n\n### Tip Calculation\n\n6-1. Calculate the tip based on the total score and analysis.\n\n   *   The total score of 68 falls into the \"Good\" service level.\n   *   The restaurant is a casual dining establishment in the USA.\n   *   The \"Good\" service level for casual dining in the USA has a tipping range of 16-20%.\n   *   The review highlights that the server accommodated a difficult customer, despite the customer's demanding behavior and negative tipping. This suggests that the server, although being put in a negative situation, still provided good service. I'll lean towards the upper end of the range.\n\n6-2. Format\n    ```json\n    {\n      \"### Video Caption 1 ###\": \"The server accommodated the customer's specific requests by providing a bowl of hot water immediately upon seating.

    "text_content": "I'm dying to know if anyone else works as a server with disabilities? Because I do. We had a mandatory work night at the restaurant I work in last week. It was absolutely slammed. Under stress I sometimes I have daydreamer seizures. They aren't usually severe or detrimental to my work. Most people couldn't even tell I have them unless I tell them and explain the signs then they say ooooohhhhh that makes sense. Slurred speach at random, starring into space for a few seconds, being a little overwhelmed if I feel like I lost any time...those sort of things. They last a few seconds and are over no one I work with has had a problem with this and to be clear before I was hired I informed them I have dyslexia and siezures so I may be a little slower but it truly has not hindered me until it allegedly did...\n\nWe have a FOH that I have butted heads with for many reasons. She has also had problems with customers claiming she would not allow them in when she was working, which she has zero authority to do and has had multiple arguments and issues with other employees. Don't ask me why she still has a job. I'm looking for another one. She spent the entire night undone about what people did on the shift before (not cleaning properly-also I didn't work this shift) I could really give a sh*t they didn't clean up, I get it, we make $2 and some change an hour....so I clean up the mess and never said anything about it because I don't care. My GOD she did though. I had to endure her wrath for the next few hours. I was backhandedly called stupid at one point which I forgot about until another coworker came to me and said she thought that was uncalled for because it had to do with reading and they all know I have dyslexia she actually did this 3 times in the night (making problems about me typing in wine names instead of searching through the one f*cking hundred wines we have on the computer). She was all over me about being to slow to get several different wines, teas, sodas and waters for a large party where some people ordered more than one drink. At this point in the night after about 10 different things she said that I can't really remember all of because there was nothing educational or helpful I start getting upset. I had a small seizure right before getting the drinks and another during when I was making sure the wines were filled evenly, I had other tables too so I had some stress. I felt it happen, I moved on but she dug in about how long it took (after delivering the drinks my table asked for more time with the menu-I don't even think it took as long as she said because of this, but I can't be sure). I had enough though later in the night when I thanked and hugged the people at the table for their very generous tip ( we had a good vibe going I asked if I could give them a hug they said yes.) She was undone and said we don't behave like that with customers. I literally don't care. (This woman yelled at me that she would fire me because she had an argument with another coworker like 2 weeks before this whole event....I won't be taking her advice on how to treat people.) They all freaked out that I made over $100 on my first 4 tables....I treat my customers like they matter because it means a lot to me when they give me literally anything because they don't have to. I left in the middle of the shift after I worked 2 hrs. I apologized at a later date to her about my reaction because at one point I told her I no longer gave a shit about what she had to say (I should have just kept it at that). After apologizing and explaining that I was having a seizure when she was getting on to me that night....this actual f*cking b*tch said, \"that's a problem.\" What the actual f*ck is that...? I've never heard something so heartless in my life. My response was that everyone who mattered in the hiring process knew I had disabilities and they chose to hire me anyway and her constantly berating before, during, and after a seizure in no way helped anyone, not even one person. She glazed over that to tell me I didn't wipe a station the day before that apology......y'all that station was f*ucking spotless I can't stress that enough 😂 I can not with this petty drama. I'm literally dying and no one knows except the people who read this. I have kidney damage (which is a possible trigger for the seizures) that is seemingly getting worse. Can't afford the medications I have to take which is why I work this job in the first place outside of the owner really needing employees -kill two birds with one stone and all but I can't imagine why no one would want to be around this hateful firebreathing she-devil. Literally spent precious time I barely have scrubbing food of the floor on my f*cking knees for it to not matter and to get treated like dog sh*t the entire night anyways. Y'all as soon as the opportunity arises I am getting the f*ck out. I can't anymore.",

Because I do. We had a mandatory work night at the restaurant I work in last week. It was absolutely slammed. Under stress I sometimes I have daydreamer seizures. They aren't usually severe or detrimental to my work. Most people couldn't even tell I have them unless I tell them and explain the signs then they say ooooohhhhh that makes sense. Slurred speach at random, starring into space for a few seconds, being a little overwhelmed if I feel like I lost any time...those sort of things. They last a few seconds and are over no one I work with has had a problem with this and to be clear before I was hired I informed them I have dyslexia and siezures so I may be a little slower but it truly has not hindered me until it allegedly did... We have a FOH that I have butted heads with for many reasons. She has also had problems with customers claiming she would not allow them in when she was working, which she has zero authority to do and has had multiple arguments and issues with other employees. Don't ask me why she still has a job. I'm looking for another one. She spent the entire night undone about what people did on the shift before not cleaning properly also I didn't work this shift I could really give a sh t they didn't clean up, I get it, we make 2 and some change an hour....so I clean up the mess and never said anything about it because I don't care. My GOD she did though. I had to endure her wrath for the next few hours. I was backhandedly called stupid at one point which I forgot about until another coworker came to me and said she thought that was uncalled for because it had to do with reading and they all know I have dyslexia she actually did this 3 times in the night making problems about me typing in wine names instead of searching through the one f cking hundred wines we have on the computer . She was all over me about being to slow to get several different wines, teas, sodas and waters for a large party where some people ordered more than one drink. At this point in the night after about 10 different things she said that I can't really remember all of because there was nothing educational or helpful I start getting upset. I had a small seizure right before getting the drinks and another during when I was making sure the wines were filled evenly, I had other tables too so I had some stress. I felt it happen, I moved on but she dug in about how long it took after delivering the drinks my table asked for more time with the menu I don't even think it took as long as she said because of this, but I can't be sure . I had enough though later in the night when I thanked and hugged the people at the table for their very generous tip we had a good vibe going I asked if I could give them a hug they said yes. She was undone and said we don't behave like that with customers. I literally don't care. This woman yelled at me that she would fire me because she had an argument with another coworker like 2 weeks before this whole event....I won't be taking her advice on how to treat people. They all freaked out that I made over 100 on my first 4 tables....I treat my customers like they matter because it means a lot to me when they give me literally anything because they don't have to. I left in the middle of the shift after I worked 2 hrs. I apologized at a later date to her about my reaction because at one point I told her I no longer gave a shit about what she had to say I should have just kept it at that . After apologizing and explaining that I was having a seizure when she was getting on to me that night....this actual f cking b tch said, \"that's a problem.\" What the actual f ck is that...? I've never heard something so heartless in my life. My response was that everyone who mattered in the hiring process knew I had disabilities and they chose to hire me anyway and her constantly berating before, during, and after a seizure in no way helped anyone, not even one person. She glazed over that to tell me I didn't wipe a station the day before that apology......y'all that station was f ucking spotless I can't stress that enough I can not with this petty drama. I'm literally dying and no one knows except the people who read this. I have kidney damage which is a possible trigger for the seizures that is seemingly getting worse. Can't afford the medications I have to take which is why I work this job in the first place outside of the owner really needing employees kill two birds with one stone and all but I can't imagine why no one would want to be around this hateful firebreathing she devil. Literally spent precious time I barely have scrubbing food of the floor on my f cking knees for it to not matter and to get treated like dog sh t the entire night anyways. Y'all as soon as the opportunity arises I am getting the f ck out. I can't anymore.\n\n### Video Caption ###\nDuring a busy shift, the server delivered drinks to a large party, experiencing perceived delays that were criticized by management. Following drink delivery, one table requested additional time with the menu. The server focused on treating customers as important, resulting in receipt of a 'very generous' [REMOVED] from one table.\n\n### User Input ###\n    1. Country: USA, Type: Casual dining\n    2. Restaurant name: Gold Spoon\n    3. Calculated subtotal: $25.00\n",
    "response": "Okay, I understand the task. I will analyze the provided information, including the video caption, user input, and the Reddit post, to calculate the appropriate tip.\n\n### Analysis of the Video Caption\n\n1-1. Video Evaluation Criteria\n\n    a) Reliability: 3. The caption mentions perceived delays and issues with drink delivery, which suggests there might be some order discrepancies or delays. However, it doesn't explicitly state mistakes. Therefore, the score is 3. (Mostly accurate orders, occasional lack of confirmation)\n    *Reasoning: The video mentions delays which could mean the orders were not perfectly handled, but it doesn't show any mistakes in order taking. It also doesn't mention confirmation of the order.*\n\n    b) Responsiveness: 2. The caption highlights issues with management's criticism, implying a negative experience with the management's response to the server. This suggests poor responsiveness. The score is 2. (Responds but with significant delays)\n    *Reasoning: The caption describes a negative interaction where management was criticizing the server. This implies poor responsiveness from management, although the responsiveness of the server is not directly mentioned.*\n\n    c) Assurance: 1. The server was criticized, and the situation seems to have caused stress. This implies a lack of confidence and ineffective handling of the situation. The score is 1. (Unable to answer menu questions, rude or unfriendly)\n    *Reasoning: The criticism from management, and the resulting stress and emotional distress suggest a lack of assurance and confidence in the server's handling of the situation.*\n\n    d) Empathy: 3. The server's focus on treating customers as important suggests some level of empathy. The server was also affected by the events that occurred. Score of 3. (Basic friendliness but lacks personalization)\n    *Reasoning: The server's actions are focused on customer satisfaction, so it indicates a level of friendliness.*\n\n    e) Tangibles: 4. The video does not provide any details about the tangibles like cleanliness of the table. This would be considered acceptable, so the score is 3. (Acceptable but lacks attention to detail)\n    *Reasoning: Since there is no information about the tangibles, I will assume it to be acceptable.*\n\n1-2. Video Score Calculation\n    Video Score = (3 + 2 + 1 + 3 + 3) * 4 = 48\n\n5.  Total Score\n    5-1. Total Score Calculation\n        Total Score = 48\n\n6.  Tip Calculation\n    6-1. Calculate the tip based on the total score and analysis.\n        a) Categorize the service level as Poor, Normal, or Good based on the total score.\n        * The total score is 48.\n        * Since the restaurant is casual dining in the USA, the score is higher than the range for Good.\n        * **Service Level: Good**\n        b) Determine the tipping percentage within the culturally appropriate range.\n        * USA, Casual Dining: Poor [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]%, Normal [6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15]%, Good [16, 17, 18, 19, 20]%\n        * Based on the reviews, there were negative aspects like management issues and delays.\n        * The server was still making an effort, which is commendable.\n        * The generous tip from the customer is a good sign.\n        * Due to the above factors, I will choose a value from the upper end of the Good range: **18%**\n        * Tip Amount = $25 * 0.18 = $4.50\n        * Total Bill = $25 + $4.50 = $29.50\n\n    6-2.

    "text_content": "I was a newbie. I had hosted for 2 years at this point but I finally got a job as a server at a semi-corporate place. I was so very excited. I loved serving and even the busiest of nights never bothered me. Attention to detail is important to me, and instantly the GM liked me because of how well I did as a rookie. She was notorious for being crazy and strict and no one liked her. But, she liked me. \n\nUp until this night I had absolutely no issues ever. It had only been a couple of weeks but I never had a complaint and any problems that occurred were fixable and from what I could tell all my customers were happy when they left. I even got a few regulars tell me I was the best service they got there. Which really meant the world to me. As time went on I started getting really good shifts. And, I was making good money. I loved the job, and the customers. \n\nUntil one lady came in. She was with her parents and two of her children. The parents were extremely nice, and I love kid so I had no issue buddying up with them. She was off from the bringing though. She was maybe in her 30s. She did not look up to me when she ordered her drink. She told her mother to shut up when she was trying to ask me about a deal we had. When I started explaining the deal anyway she snapped again “you can see the deal on the menu, I don’t know what your asking her!” I did not want to upset her anymore, so I point to where it said the deal and the mother nodded. \n\nI bring back the drinks and admittedly I did make a small mistake. She has originally ordered a lemonade but before I walked away she changed her mind to a water. I nodded, but the interaction previously kinda threw me off and I brought her the lemonade by mistake. She was the last drink I put down and Instantly when I reach down to give it to her I realize the mistake. I go to pick it up and apologize but before I can she huffs in disgust “I told you I wanted a water not a lemonade!” She yelled aggressively. I nervously laughed it off and blamed myself, I told her I must have been in autopilot and I would fix this right away. She asks if she will be charged for the lemonade, I have not rung in drinks yet so I assure her that no she will not. \n\nAll else is calm and I’m taking care of other tables before their food comes out. Her and her mother ordered burgers. I hand out all the plates and they all begin eating. After a couple minutes I check back and ask how everything is. The daughter is completely silent. The mother looks kind of worried and hesitantly says her burger is over cooked, she wanted medium but it was well done. I profusely apologize and take a look, it was a little more on the brown side. I tell her I will have her another made and I will get my manager. Then the daughter pipes up and says hers is wrong also. I repeat my apologies and tell them the manager will fix the problem (aka take the burgers off the order) while I get them new burgers. The mother insisted I don’t do that, she would just eat her burger there was no issue. To my surprise the daughter says nothing. I ask again is she sure she does not want a new burger, she once again repeats that no neither of them do. \n\nI still go to my manager and explain the situation. She comps the meals and gives them a free desert. I happily tell them this news and the mother seems really thankful. Still, nothing from the daughter. \n\nThe mother tips me 20% and all else seems well. The daughter did not look at me for the rest of the meal, but she also didn’t snap or yell at me. She did yell at her children a few times for minor things, rather loudly and aggressively. But, she seemed calmer. \n\nThe next day I come onto work I get called into the back by a manager and my GM. They ask me if I know what it’s about. I confusingly say no, I don’t. They stare at me sternly, not believing me. I ask them what happened, and if I did something wrong. I had never seen my GM mad at me about anything before. \n\n“Explain what happened last night with that table with the burgers” she tells me. It took me a couple seconds to remember what she meant. It hadn’t been something that stood out to me because it was a rather minuscule situation. But, I tell her what happened about the burgers being overcooked and me getting a manager to comp them. She then pulls out a paper with a really long paragraph. She hands it to me and tells me to read it out loud. \n\nBasically it was the biggest character assassination I ever knew possible. It was all written by the daughter. She said I was rude, called me a bitch, and said I acted like they were a nuisance and a waste of my time. I talked down on her when I said “excuse me honey” when she spoke. The only time I had said that was to her son when I reached over to hand her her water after the lemonade situation. Not to her, and not condescending. She told them her burger was burnt and she couldn’t eat it. Dispute her finishing it. She told them I rolled my eyes when she complained. And I took 30 minutes to give them a check, which was also not true. All I had to do was get the manager to comp the meals, and her mother was given the check before their meal was completely finished and desert was brought out. She also said I charged her for a lemonade she never ordered. I know I didn’t, but even if I had why wouldn’t she have said something then?\n\nApparently my GM had called her the next morning and they were on the phone for an hour. And, my GM couldn’t even get a word in because the lady was so angered she was screaming the whole conversation. By this time I was crying, I hate to admit that but I had no defense. I had no proof none of this was true. And, despite all my good reviews they believed her. Maybe not fully, but they said there was no one someone was that mad if I had done nothing wrong. They made me read a paper on their policy of treating customers. They told me I am not allowed to call anyone honey. And, what hurt the most was, they told me they might have overestimated my abilities on handling myself. And, that I would be put back in the smallest 3 table section. \n\nUltimately my hours dropped. And, the GM no longer liked me. No matter how good I did after that my reputation never recovered. I was forced to find another job. Without them as a reference I had no documentable serving experience, so I had to work my way up and a different place now. I make significantly less money, even a year later, than I would have there. All because she complained and got another free meal. She practically ruined my life over burgers. \n\n\n\nEdit: Thank you for the support!!! It’s so encouraging read kind comments and it feels like at least reddit has my back on this situation... lol. I no longer work at this place. And I have never had a situation this bad ever happen to me since. I genuinely love serving and I really do not get overwhelmed or angry about much. This place has other locations that have shut down at a high rate over the last couple years, and that should have been a warning sign before I began working at this location.\n\nEDIT 2: also I kinda realize that I think this was a little bit more of an elaborate scam than I thought at the time. The fact she didn’t speak up in front of her parents makes me believe she wanted to cause a scene after the fact. The mother was pretty insistent that she did not want to get free food and I was actually the one who asked the manager to comp it, the mother never asked me to do that. Makes me think that since the daughter remained quite up until they left means she wanted to take more advantage of the situation behind everyone else’s back. ",

I had hosted for 2 years at this point but I finally got a job as a server at a semi corporate place. I was so very excited. I loved serving and even the busiest of nights never bothered me. Attention to detail is important to me, and instantly the GM liked me because of how well I did as a rookie. She was notorious for being crazy and strict and no one liked her. But, she liked me. Up until this night I had absolutely no issues ever. It had only been a couple of weeks but I never had a complaint and any problems that occurred were fixable and from what I could tell all my customers were happy when they left. I even got a few regulars tell me I was the best service they got there. Which really meant the world to me. As time went on I started getting really good shifts. And, I was making good money. I loved the job, and the customers. Until one lady came in. She was with her parents and two of her children. The parents were extremely nice, and I love kid so I had no issue buddying up with them. She was off from the bringing though. She was maybe in her 30s. She did not look up to me when she ordered her drink. She told her mother to shut up when she was trying to ask me about a deal we had. When I started explaining the deal anyway she snapped again you can see the deal on the menu, I don t know what your asking her! I did not want to upset her anymore, so I point to where it said the deal and the mother nodded. I bring back the drinks and admittedly I did make a small mistake. She has originally ordered a lemonade but before I walked away she changed her mind to a water. I nodded, but the interaction previously kinda threw me off and I brought her the lemonade by mistake. She was the last drink I put down and Instantly when I reach down to give it to her I realize the mistake. I go to pick it up and apologize but before I can she huffs in disgust I told you I wanted a water not a lemonade! She yelled aggressively. I nervously laughed it off and blamed myself, I told her I must have been in autopilot and I would fix this right away. She asks if she will be charged for the lemonade, I have not rung in drinks yet so I assure her that no she will not. All else is calm and I m taking care of other tables before their food comes out. Her and her mother ordered burgers. I hand out all the plates and they all begin eating. After a couple minutes I check back and ask how everything is. The daughter is completely silent. The mother looks kind of worried and hesitantly says her burger is over cooked, she wanted medium but it was well done. I profusely apologize and take a look, it was a little more on the brown side. I tell her I will have her another made and I will get my manager. Then the daughter pipes up and says hers is wrong also. I repeat my apologies and tell them the manager will fix the problem aka take the burgers off the order while I get them new burgers. The mother insisted I don t do that, she would just eat her burger there was no issue. To my surprise the daughter says nothing. I ask again is she sure she does not want a new burger, she once again repeats that no neither of them do. I still go to my manager and explain the situation. She comps the meals and gives them a free desert. I happily tell them this news and the mother seems really thankful. Still, nothing from the daughter. The mother tips me 20 and all else seems well. The daughter did not look at me for the rest of the meal, but she also didn t snap or yell at me. She did yell at her children a few times for minor things, rather loudly and aggressively. But, she seemed calmer. The next day I come onto work I get called into the back by a manager and my GM. They ask me if I know what it s about. I confusingly say no, I don t. They stare at me sternly, not believing me. I ask them what happened, and if I did something wrong. I had never seen my GM mad at me about anything before. Explain what happened last night with that table with the burgers she tells me. It took me a couple seconds to remember what she meant. It hadn t been something that stood out to me because it was a rather minuscule situation. But, I tell her what happened about the burgers being overcooked and me getting a manager to comp them. She then pulls out a paper with a really long paragraph. She hands it to me and tells me to read it out loud. Basically it was the biggest character assassination I ever knew possible. It was all written by the daughter. She said I was rude, called me a bitch, and said I acted like they were a nuisance and a waste of my time. I talked down on her when I said excuse me honey when she spoke. The only time I had said that was to her son when I reached over to hand her her water after the lemonade situation. Not to her, and not condescending. She told them her burger was burnt and she couldn t eat it. Dispute her finishing it. She told them I rolled my eyes when she complained. And I took 30 minutes to give them a check, which was also not true. All I had to do was get the manager to comp the meals, and her mother was given the check before their meal was completely finished and desert was brought out. She also said I charged her for a lemonade she never ordered. I know I didn t, but even if I had why wouldn t she have said something then? Apparently my GM had called her the next morning and they were on the phone for an hour. And, my GM couldn t even get a word in because the lady was so angered she was screaming the whole conversation. By this time I was crying, I hate to admit that but I had no defense. I had no proof none of this was true. And, despite all my good reviews they believed her. Maybe not fully, but they said there was no one someone was that mad if I had done nothing wrong. They made me read a paper on their policy of treating customers. They told me I am not allowed to call anyone honey. And, what hurt the most was, they told me they might have overestimated my abilities on handling myself. And, that I would be put back in the smallest 3 table section. Ultimately my hours dropped. And, the GM no longer liked me. No matter how good I did after that my reputation never recovered. I was forced to find another job. Without them as a reference I had no documentable serving experience, so I had to work my way up and a different place now. I make significantly less money, even a year later, than I would have there. All because she complained and got another free meal. She practically ruined my life over burgers. Edit: Thank you for the support!!! It s so encouraging read kind comments and it feels like at least reddit has my back on this situation... lol. I no longer work at this place. And I have never had a situation this bad ever happen to me since. I genuinely love serving and I really do not get overwhelmed or angry about much. This place has other locations that have shut down at a high rate over the last couple years, and that should have been a warning sign before I began working at this location. EDIT 2: also I kinda realize that I think this was a little bit more of an elaborate scam than I thought at the time. The fact she didn t speak up in front of her parents makes me believe she wanted to cause a scene after the fact. The mother was pretty insistent that she did not want to get free food and I was actually the one who asked the manager to comp it, the mother never asked me to do that. Makes me think that since the daughter remained quite up until they left means she wanted to take more advantage of the situation behind everyone else s back.\n\n### Video Caption ###\nThe server took drink and food orders, making an initial mistake on one drink order (lemonade instead of water).

But the best part of the night came when the 3 4 year old says, in their cute little attempted language, 'Thanks for the noodles and ketchup and cake' then launches himself from the booth and wraps his arms around me in the best hug I've had in months. Made my WEEK! That there's a tale from retail I hope y'all can appreciate almost as much as I did.\n\n### Video Caption ###\nThe server worked during a busy dinner rush, took orders, and delivered the food.

    "response": "### Analysis ###\n\n1-1. Video Evaluation Criteria\n    a) Reliability: 3 - Mostly accurate orders, occasional lack of confirmation. The caption mentions food delivery but doesn't specify the order accuracy. The server did not have major mistakes, but there's no mention of confirmation procedures.\n    b) Responsiveness: 3 - Average response speed, acceptable performance. The caption doesn't explicitly comment on the speed of service.\n    c) Assurance: 3 - Can explain the menu but lacks confidence. The caption doesn't mention the server's menu knowledge, but the server was able to satisfy a customer request, which indicates basic competence.\n    d) Empathy: 4 - Remembers customer preferences, offers personalized services like birthday events. The server recognized the birthday and arranged a special dessert, going above and beyond the basic service.\n    e) Tangibles: 4 - Uniform and table settings are tidy, cleanliness maintained. The caption doesn't provide any information on tangibles. This score assumes that the server follows general restaurant standards.\n\n1-2. Video Score Calculation\n    Video Score = (3 + 3 + 3 + 4 + 4) * 4 = 68\n\n5. Total Score\n    5-1. Total Score Calculation\n        Total Score = 68\n\n6. Tip Calculation\n    6-1. Calculate the tip based on the total score and analysis.\n        a) The service level is categorized as Good because the total score is 68, which is above 15.\n        b) The tipping percentage within the culturally appropriate range for the USA, casual dining, and Good service is between 16% and 20%.\n        c) Although the service was good, the initial tip was slightly above 15%, which is a positive indicator. The server went above and beyond by recognizing the birthday and arranging a special dessert, the tip should be at the higher end of the range.\n    6-2.

Our bartender kept complaining about how much alcohol was being ordered, but we all know drunk people are the best tippers. \n\nAnyways during our dinner rush, I had a four top. All middle age women, the type you expect to have problems from but I'm damn good at dealing with anyone. Only lost it one time in all my years of service jobs.\n\nThese ladies, although incredibly needy, appeared to love me. Probably because I got them every request they asked of me, but they were friendly the whole time. Never to the point I dropped the mask, but they definitely believed I liked them.\n\nNow after they leave I picked up the checkbook. It was during a rush and actually wasn't my table, I was covering for someone who was in the weeds. Took me a bit to grab it, but there was something strange. \n\nThey had left 15 in the tip line, however the total added up to 25 for the tip.\n\n15 is just a little bit under 20%. About what to expect from one of these tables.\n\nSo, my question is what do you do in this situation? They are gone, so asking them anything is impossible. The total they had written was 101, so presumably that's what they expected to spend.\n\nEdit: First two comments and it's already contradictory. Very interesting that there isn't a set way to handle this.\n\nEdit 2: Felt like saying I did take the total in this scenario. Honestly I think they meant to leave me 15, if they hadn't left I would have asked, but they intended to pay 101 so that's what they were charged. Can't complain about an extra 10 bucks!",

Idk what is going on, but the kitchen is taking an hour hour and a half to get food out the window. I had a table, about 12 people, who ended up with a bill of 377. While the ringleader paid, he loudly explained, with more words unsuitable for younger readers, and a finger in my face, never in my life have I ever received such terrible service. You should be ashamed. Was the wait long? Yes. Was that fair? No. But after everything I did in MY power to make sure the wait wasn t unpleasant, I don t think it was fair to be treated that way. He did not tip, not a dime was left on the table, and I cried for a solid five minutes, because I owed the kitchen 20 at that point. Do you have an experience like this? What is the largest bill you ve cashed out and received no laughably little tip?\n\n### Video Caption ###\nA server managed a large table that experienced a significant delay (1-1.5 hours) due to the kitchen. The server states they attempted to mitigate the impact of the long wait for the table, although specific actions taken are not detailed. A customer expressed extreme dissatisfaction with the service, citing the long wait time.\n\n### User Input ###\n    1. Country: USA, Type: Casual dining\n    2. Restaurant name: Gold Spoon\n    3. Calculated subtotal: $25.00\n",
    "response": "Okay, I will analyze the provided information and calculate the appropriate tip.\n\n### Analysis ###\n\n1-1. Video Evaluation Criteria\n    a) Reliability: 3 - Mostly accurate orders, occasional lack of confirmation. The video caption indicates a long wait time due to kitchen delays, but doesn't explicitly mention order inaccuracies. Therefore, the server likely handled the orders accurately but the kitchen's performance affected the overall experience.\n        *Reasoning: The video indicates a long wait time due to the kitchen, which is outside the server's direct control. The caption doesn't provide any information about the order's accuracy.*\n\n    b) Responsiveness: 3 - Average response speed, acceptable performance. The caption mentions the server attempted to mitigate the wait time impact, suggesting some level of responsiveness, but the extent and effectiveness are unknown.\n        *Reasoning: The video doesn't specifically detail the server's response time or behavior during the wait, but it implies some level of effort to address the issue.*\n\n    c) Assurance: 3 - Can explain the menu but lacks confidence. The caption doesn't indicate anything about menu questions or confidence. It focuses solely on the impact of the kitchen's slow service.\n        *Reasoning: The video provides no information about the waiter's knowledge and confidence, but it focuses on the customer's dissatisfaction with the long wait time.*\n\n    d) Empathy: 3 - Basic friendliness but lacks personalization. The server tried to mitigate the impact of the wait, but the caption doesn't offer details about personalized service or empathy shown.\n        *Reasoning: The server's efforts to mitigate the impact of the wait suggest some degree of empathy but with no mention of personalized care or understanding of the customer's feelings.*\n\n    e) Tangibles: 4 - Uniform and table settings are tidy, cleanliness maintained. The video does not give any specific information, but it's a causal dining restaurant, so the restaurant's and server's tidiness is taken for granted.\n        *Reasoning: Since no evidence suggests otherwise, assume the restaurant and server's environment is tidy and maintained.*\n\n1-2. Video Score Calculation\n    Video Score = (3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 4) * 4 = 64\n\n5.  Total Score\n    5-1. Total Score Calculation\n        Total Score = Video Score = 64\n\n6.  Tip Calculation\n    6-1. Calculate the tip based on the total score and analysis.\n        a) Categorize the service level as Poor, Normal, or Good based on the total score and review content.\n            The total score is 64.\n            For USA casual dining, the score falls into the range of Normal [6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15]%.\n        b) Determine the tipping percentage within the culturally appropriate range according to the selected country and restaurant type.\n            Since the customer was very dissatisfied, and left no tip at all, the tipping amount should be set to a low value.\n            The customer's dissatisfaction was not the server's fault, but the kitchen's fault.\n            For USA casual dining, Normal tipping range is 6-15%. Therefore, the tip amount should be 6%.\n    6-2.

A long stream of Suburbans would drop the kids off and for a couple of hours we would be wall-to-wall teenagers. To their credit, the parents of these kids did a good job raising and they typically tipped us well. But even though they were relatively well-behaved they were still teenagers and were prone to showing off.\n\nOn one of those nights I got a three-top of guys who I would guess were sophomores. As I was finishing up at another table I overheard them bragging to each other, \"Well last time I was here I had eleven Dr. Peppers!\" \"Oh yeah? I had twelve!\"\n\nSo rather than doing my usual greet I went to the back and pulled three water pitchers and filled them with Dr. Pepper and just a little ice. The MoD saw me and said, \"We're not supposed to do that.\" I told her what I had overheard and she smiled and said, \"I don't see anything.\"\n\nI greeted the guys, put down three straws in front of them and said \"Dr. Pepper for you! Dr. Pepper for you! Dr. Pepper for you!\"\n\nThey looked up at me with awe and said something to the effect of, \"dude, your the best waiter we've ever had!\"\n\nI took their order and put it into the pos. When I came by their table they were pounding those pitchers hard. By the time their food arrived they were ready for refills. So I got three more pitchers of Dr. Pepper and brought them to the table. They didn't seem as excited this time.\n\nAfter a bit I asked them how things were and they said everything was great. I pointed out that they still had a lot of Dr. Pepper left. They said something like, \"Kinda getting full.\" I asked them, \"Didn't you have twelve last time you were here?\" To which I put on my best imitation of a coach and said, \"IF YOU WANT VICTORY YOU HAVE TO **REALLY WANT IT!**\" I was surprised how well they responded to that ploy as they started chugging those pitchers again.\n\nWhen I got back to the table they asked for their tickets as their ride was there for them. They tipped me 25%. I have to admit, I kinda felt guilty as I watched them stagger out the door all looking like they were going to hurl.",

I started whenever I was 16 and couldn’t serve any alcohol, but I am now working my way up in one of the more classy restaurants in my town. I’ve been at this place a couple of months, and I’ve always had great success around the holidays. I don’t know if it’s people are feeling more generous or they feel bad I am not like them and with their families. Anyway, had a table of 9 last night celebrating a graduation because the grandparents were in town. We at my place have an automatic 18% grat on any table over 8. I inform the lady who asked for the tab as well as I told her about the automatic grat that had already been added. She told me that it wasn’t a problem, and she was happy that was in place. Later after they had finished paying the grandmother came up to me and thanked me for the corny jokes with the family and the excellent service and handed me some money that was folded up. I thanked her and said that she was too kind for anything left over. Well whenever I got back the serving station at my place I reach into my pocket and found that her and her family had gave me 200 dollars extra. I quickly ran out back out on to the floor and tried to thank them again, however by this time they were long gone. \n\nI then did what almost every server I know would do, I went to my local watering hole and tipped my bartender over the bill cost. \n\nHappy holiday y’all.

The server clearly communicated that an automatic 18% [REMOVED] had been added to the bill. The server engaged with the family, including telling \"corny jokes\". A customer approached the server post-payment to express thanks for the service and jokes, stating the service was \"excellent\".\n\n### User Input ###\n    1.

    "response": "Okay, I will analyze the provided information and calculate the appropriate tip.\n\n### Analysis of the Reddit Post and Video Caption\n\nThe Reddit post describes a positive customer experience. The server was attentive, communicated clearly about the automatic gratuity, and engaged with the family, making them feel comfortable and entertained. The grandmother's feedback (\"excellent service\" and \"corny jokes\") strongly indicates high customer satisfaction. The fact that the family left an additional $200 tip, even after the automatic gratuity, is a clear indication of exceptional service.\n\n### Video Evaluation Criteria\n\nSince we already have a Video Caption, the evaluation criteria will be based on the provided caption.\n\n1-1. Video Evaluation Criteria\n\n*   a) Reliability: **5** - The caption indicates no issues with order accuracy or billing. The automatic gratuity was clearly communicated.\n    *   *Justification*: The post highlights good communication regarding the bill, so a high score is justified.\n*   b) Responsiveness: **5** - The server was attentive and responsive, engaging with the customers.\n    *   *Justification*: The server's engagement and jokes suggest a high level of responsiveness and attentiveness.\n*   c) Assurance: **5** - The server's ability to make \"corny jokes\" suggests confident and friendly interaction.\n    *   *Justification*: The willingness to engage in jokes suggests the server built rapport and confidence.\n*   d) Empathy: **5** - The server's actions, including the jokes, show a genuine effort to connect with and provide a positive experience for the family.\n    *   *Justification*: The server went above and beyond.\n*   e) Tangibles: **4** - While there's no information in the prompt about tangibles, it's safe to assume cleanliness standards were met.\n    *   *Justification*: No negative comments from the customer about tangibles are available.\n\n1-2. Video Score Calculation\n\nVideo Score = (5 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 4) \\* 4 = 96\n\n5. Total Score\n\n5-1. Total Score Calculation\n\nTotal Score = Video Score = 96\n\n6. Tip Calculation\n\n6-1. Calculate the tip based on the total score and analysis.\n\n*   Service Level: Good (Because the video score is high).\n*   Tipping Percentage: The country is USA, and the restaurant type is Casual Dining.\n    *   Casual Dining: Poor \\[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]%, Normal \\[6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15]%, Good \\[16, 17, 18, 19, 20]%\n    *   Given the excellent service, the tip percentage should be at the high end of the \"Good\" range.\n*   Based on the excellent service demonstrated in the video, I'll assign the upper limit of the \"Good\" range, which is 20%.\n\n6-2.

Friday and Saturday nights I work the lounge blahblahblah.\n\nHad a seizure about a week ago and lost my grandmother thursday. They planned the funeral today, and to say the least I was not on my game tonight.\n\nLuckily- in the lounge there is a looser feel because everyone is drunk and it is packed shoulder to shoulder with people listening to the loud-as-fuck band. \n\nI am on my last table after closing the kitchen 30 minutes before that. The band is still playing and there are still plenty of people drinking at the bar. I decide to join the rest of the crew outside for a post-shift cigarette.\n\nI go check on my last two top, a mother and daughter, the mother is pretty drunk; but they smile at me and give me the okay symbol. \n\nI join my friends outside, we smoke a cigarette; and I admittedly take my time because the vibe my table gave was that they were trying to enjoy their drinks while listening to the band.  I go back in to check on them-\n\n\"We ready for another round ladies?\" I yell over the band.\n\nThe mom looks pissed \"I asked you for the check\" She says in an indignant drunk voice, the daughter is looking surprised that she said that. \n\nI scruntch my face at the answer \"umm, I dont think you did; but Ill go grab it right quick. Sorry bout that\" I finish with a smile\n\n\"Yes I did, I did this-\" she draws a check mark in the air with her finger. \"When people do that it means we were ready for the check.\"\n\n\"Okay, let me get it right quick.\" I keep my shit eating smile on and very quickly grab the check. I return and the card is sitting on the table, I drop the check on the table and grab the card \"Lemme go run this right quick.\" \n\n\"Wait wait wait.\" She grabs my arm and spends almost a full fucking minute looking over the 34$ check. \"Okay go ahead.\" I force a smile and walk off\n\nI am so fucking over it at this point but hold my tongue.\n\nI drop the sign receipts back at the table. \"Y'all have a great night.\" \n\nThe daughter dawns a big smile \"Thanks so much\"  trying to recover this interaction after her mothers obvious shitty attitude. \n\nI walk off- start entering in my tips for the night at the near by POS.\n\nGo back to the table after they left and grab their signed receipt. \n\n-$0- tip and in giant letters at the top\n\"LAZY ASSHOLE, FIRE HIM\" \n\nOh hell to the fuck no.\n\nI grab the receipt and go outside to find them right outside the front door.\n\n\"Excuse me mam.\" I tap her shoulder; she drunkenly turns with low eyes.\n\n\"This shit right here?\" I crumple the receipt in her face \"This shit doesn't fly around here. I wanted to say, sorry I was a little distracted tonight. But I literally just lost my grandmother.\"\n\n\"So take this back\" I throw the reciept ball into her face, it bounces off her forehead \"and get out of here, you arent welcome back.\"\n\nShe bends down and grabs the receipt ball \"Oh you'll hear about this.\"\n\n\"I AM A FUCKING HUMAN LADY, NOT JUST SOME MACHINE THAT BRINGS YOU FUCKING FOOD.\" I shout  back at her. Everyone outside is looking at this point. I turn around and storm back inside to my manager and tell him I snapped on a customer. \n\nThe biggest thing I cant get over. What if I didnt work at such a cool spot. What if I had gotten fired because that lady wrote that on that check. She really thought I deserved to loose my job because I took 10 extra minutes to bring a check.\n\nWhat the fuck is wrong with people.",

You guys have heard from me a buncha times before, I work at a busy tourist spot in New Orleans. Friday and Saturday nights I work the lounge blahblahblah. Had a seizure about a week ago and lost my grandmother thursday. They planned the funeral today, and to say the least I was not on my game tonight. Luckily in the lounge there is a looser feel because everyone is drunk and it is packed shoulder to shoulder with people listening to the loud as fuck band. I am on my last table after closing the kitchen 30 minutes before that. The band is still playing and there are still plenty of people drinking at the bar. I decide to join the rest of the crew outside for a post shift cigarette. I go check on my last two top, a mother and daughter, the mother is pretty drunk; but they smile at me and give me the okay symbol. I join my friends outside, we smoke a cigarette; and I admittedly take my time because the vibe my table gave was that they were trying to enjoy their drinks while listening to the band. I go back in to check on them \"We ready for another round ladies?\" I yell over the band. The mom looks pissed \"I asked you for the check\" She says in an indignant drunk voice, the daughter is looking surprised that she said that. I scruntch my face at the answer \"umm, I dont think you did; but Ill go grab it right quick. Sorry bout that\" I finish with a smile \"Yes I did, I did this \" she draws a check mark in the air with her finger. \"When people do that it means we were ready for the check.\" \"Okay, let me get it right quick.\" I keep my shit eating smile on and very quickly grab the check. I return and the card is sitting on the table, I drop the check on the table and grab the card \"Lemme go run this right quick.\" \"Wait wait wait.\" She grabs my arm and spends almost a full fucking minute looking over the 34 check. \"Okay go ahead.\" I force a smile and walk off I am so fucking over it at this point but hold my tongue. I drop the sign receipts back at the table. \"Y'all have a great night.\" The daughter dawns a big smile \"Thanks so much\" trying to recover this interaction after her mothers obvious shitty attitude. I walk off start entering in my tips for the night at the near by POS. Go back to the table after they left and grab their signed receipt. 0 tip and in giant letters at the top \"LAZY ASSHOLE, FIRE HIM\" Oh hell to the fuck no. I grab the receipt and go outside to find them right outside the front door. \"Excuse me mam.\" I tap her shoulder; she drunkenly turns with low eyes. \"This shit right here?\" I crumple the receipt in her face \"This shit doesn't fly around here. I wanted to say, sorry I was a little distracted tonight. But I literally just lost my grandmother.\" \"So take this back\" I throw the reciept ball into her face, it bounces off her forehead \"and get out of here, you arent welcome back.\" She bends down and grabs the receipt ball \"Oh you'll hear about this.\" \"I AM A FUCKING HUMAN LADY, NOT JUST SOME MACHINE THAT BRINGS YOU FUCKING FOOD.\" I shout back at her. Everyone outside is looking at this point. I turn around and storm back inside to my manager and tell him I snapped on a customer. The biggest thing I cant get over. What if I didnt work at such a cool spot. What if I had gotten fired because that lady wrote that on that check. She really thought I deserved to loose my job because I took 10 extra minutes to bring a check. What the fuck is wrong with people.\n\n### Video Caption ###\nThe server checked on the table then delayed returning, later asking about another round instead of providing the check. The server initially disputed the customer's claim of asking for the check, but quickly retrieved it while maintaining a visibly strained demeanor. After processing payment, the server later confronted the customer outside, throwing the receipt and shouting insults in response to a note left on the [REMOVED] line.\n\n### User Input ###\n    1.

    "response": "Here's an analysis and tip calculation based on the provided information:\n\n### Video Analysis\n\n1.  **Video Evaluation Criteria**\n\n    a)  **Reliability:** 3. The server made a mistake by initially not remembering the check request. However, the order itself (assuming only drinks were ordered) was likely accurate. The delay in bringing the check and the later confrontation detract from this score.\n    *Justification:* While the server eventually provided the check, the initial miscommunication and subsequent delay indicate a lack of attentiveness. The server's confrontation with the customer also reveals a lack of professionalism that impacts the reliability score.\n    b)  **Responsiveness:** 2. The server was slow to respond to the check request, leading to the customer's frustration.\n    *Justification:* The delay in bringing the check shows a lack of responsiveness. The server's response to the check request wasn't immediate, and the later confrontation further highlights poor responsiveness.\n    c)  **Assurance:** 1. The server's demeanor and actions, including disputing the check request and ultimately confronting the customer, are far from professional. They did not inspire customer confidence.\n    *Justification:* The server's actions throughout the interaction did not provide assurance. Arguing with the customer and the later confrontation completely break any pretense of a professional demeanor.\n    d)  **Empathy:** 1. The server showed no empathy during the interaction, especially regarding the customer’s concerns, and displayed anger and hostility during the confrontation.\n    *Justification:* The server showed no empathy at all. The response was rude and confrontational, completely ignoring the customer's perspective.\n    e)  **Tangibles:** 4. The video doesn't explicitly mention the cleanliness of the table, but the review is unrelated to tangibles.\n    *Justification:* Since the video doesn't contain information about the cleanliness, I can only assume it is normal.\n\n2.  **Video Score Calculation**\n\n    Video Score = (3 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 4) * 4 = 44\n\n### Total Score\n\n5-1. Total Score Calculation\n   Total Score = 44\n\n### Tip Calculation\n\n6-1. Calculate the tip based on the total score and analysis.\n\n*   Service Level: Poor. The server's behavior, as described in the video and the user review, indicates very poor service.\n*   Tipping Percentage: USA, Casual dining: Poor \\[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]%. Given the extremely negative interaction, and the user’s poor experience. Zero tip is the only ethical choice.\n*   Ethical Considerations: The server's actions (confrontation, use of profanity, and the note written on the receipt) justify a 0% tip.\n\n6-2.

She said she just didn't want it too tomato-y or onion-y and that the pico was fine. I said okay and put it in. She kept making jokes about how she is picky and this is typical of her and she's so quirky. \n\nThey proceed to run me around (napkins, a new drink, want to change drink, second person now wants to change drink, salt and pepper before food arrives ect.)

They responded to numerous separate requests for items throughout the meal and managed seating for additional guests, cleaning a messy table left behind. The server attempted to follow ordering procedure for a late arrival while multitasking with dishes. Customers reported feeling they had to ask for everything.\n\n### User Input ###\n    1. Country: USA, Type: Casual dining\n    2. Restaurant name: Gold Spoon\n    3. Calculated subtotal: $25.00\n",
    "response": "Okay, I will analyze the scenario, evaluate the video based on the provided criteria, calculate the tip, and present the results in the requested format.\n\n### Analysis of the Reddit Post and Video Caption\nThe Reddit post describes a challenging dining experience. The server handled multiple customer requests, custom orders, and the addition of extra guests. The customers, particularly the omelet-ordering individual, were described as difficult and picky. Their constant requests and changes put a strain on the server. The video caption corroborates these events, stating that the server responded to numerous requests and handled the custom order. The customer's perception, as stated in the Reddit post, was that they felt they had to ask for everything.\n\n### Video Evaluation Criteria and Scoring\n\n1-1. Video Evaluation Criteria\n\n    a) Reliability: 3\n    *   **Justification:** The server took multiple orders and handled a custom omelet, but there were also multiple requests for items and modifications to the order. While the server managed, the constant changes suggest the potential for errors or omissions in a busy environment. Though the caption does not indicate errors, the sheer number of requests creates a higher possibility for mistakes compared to a standard order.\n\n    b) Responsiveness: 4\n    *   **Justification:** The server responded to the customer's requests in a timely manner throughout the meal, but the customer felt they needed to request everything. The video caption indicates the server did address requests but did not always anticipate needs proactively.\n\n    c) Assurance: 3\n    *   **Justification:** The server clarified ingredients and handled the complex omelet order, but the customer perceived the need to continually ask for items. While the server was likely polite and professional, the high number of requests might have made the customers feel less assured, as if the basics were not being covered. The need to ask for many things and the customers' perceptions of this, implies a moderate level of confidence and explanation, but did not \"earn customer trust\".\n\n    d) Empathy: 3\n    *   **Justification:** The server likely maintained a baseline level of friendliness and politeness. However, the post and caption do not reveal an attempt to personalize the service or proactively address the customer's feelings or predict their needs. The server did accommodate a difficult group, and may have tried to show empathy in their responses.\n\n    e) Tangibles: 4\n    *   **Justification:** There is no information provided about the restaurant's environment in either the video or the reddit post. Therefore, I'll assume that the server provided good table service and that the uniform and table setting were tidy and well maintained.\n\n1-2. Video Score Calculation\n    Video Score = (3 + 4 + 3 + 3 + 4) * 4 = 68\n\n5.  Total Score\n    5-1. Total Score Calculation\n        Total Score = 68\n\n6.  Tip Calculation\n    6-1. Calculate the tip based on the total score and analysis.\n        a) The service level is categorized as Normal.\n        b) Since the service level is Normal and the restaurant type is Casual Dining in the USA, the tipping range is [6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15]%.\n            *   The Reddit post and video show the customer being picky and difficult.\n            *   The customers are the reason for the server needing to do so much.\n            *   The customers left a small tip, which is a key indicator of perceived service quality.\n            *   The tip will fall in the lower side of the normal service range.\n        c) Since the customer's review on the service provided in the video indicates that the service was normal, and the customer also left a very small tip, then, 8% is the perfect tipping percentage.\n\n7. Format\n    7-1. Analysis Output Format\n        The analysis is presented in Markdown format, as requested.\n    7-2.

Like there's absolutely no reason for her to be doing this, is like, some type of server technique I'm not aware of? Maybe it helps her hear better? \n\nMy conclusion was she was being rude and insulting me (for whatever reason), and so when the bill finally came around (again she kept trying to be flirty with me, playing with her hair and such) I gave her a 0% tip for being super rude the whole time. I almost feel bad, because she was probably just trying to pay some bills and pulling all the stops out to squeeze some money, but my autistic ass came to the conclusion she was insulting me lmao.",

This happened back when I was 16, though from an outsiders perspective most people thought I was 19 for some reason I was out with my brother getting a meal before the movie and we had this youngish looking waiter probably around late 20s , and every time she kept leaning forward, making direct eye contact, pushing her chest together, tilting her head and talking in a UwU type voice. Now, I'm autistic, I can't understand flirting, or social cues in general, I only realize this was someone trying to flirt too months ago because of a tiktok, so the entire time she's doing this and she did it literally every time she came around and I'm trying to figure out what she's doing?!!? Like there's absolutely no reason for her to be doing this, is like, some type of server technique I'm not aware of? Maybe it helps her hear better? My conclusion was she was being rude and insulting me for whatever reason , and so when the bill finally came around again she kept trying to be flirty with me, playing with her hair and such I gave her a 0 tip for being super rude the whole time. I almost feel bad, because she was probably just trying to pay some bills and pulling all the stops out to squeeze some money, but my autistic ass came to the conclusion she was insulting me lmao.\n\n### Video Caption ###\nThe server frequently interacted with the customer, consistently exhibiting specific behaviors such as leaning forward, making direct eye contact, tilting her head, and talking in a distinctive voice. She also engaged in actions like pushing her chest together and playing with her hair during these interactions. The text does not provide details on her handling of service aspects like order accuracy, timing, or standard attentiveness to needs.\n\n### User Input ###\n    1.

Video Evaluation Criteria\n\n*   **a) Reliability:** Score 3.\n    *   **Reason:** The video description doesn't mention any issues with order accuracy or mistakes. It focuses on the server's behavior, not the practical aspects of the service. The lack of information means we cannot give it a higher score. The service was not mentioned in the video.\n*   **b) Responsiveness:** Score 3.\n    *   **Reason:** The video describes interactions. While the server approached the customer, the description does not provide information on response speed or proactiveness. There is not enough information to increase the score.\n*   **c) Assurance:** Score 2.\n    *   **Reason:** The video focuses on the server's behavior. While the video shows interactions, the description doesn't cover whether the server could answer menu questions or handle the situation with confidence.\n*   **d) Empathy:** Score 1.\n    *   **Reason:** Based on the customer's experience, the server's actions, while possibly intended to be friendly, were interpreted as rude and insulting. The server's behavior did not indicate an understanding of the customer's emotional state.\n*   **e) Tangibles:** Score 3.\n    *   **Reason:** The video doesn't provide information about the cleanliness of the table, utensils, or the server's uniform. However, assuming a basic level of service.\n\n### 1-2. Video Score Calculation\n\n*   Video Score = (3 + 3 + 2 + 1 + 3) * 4 = 48\n\n### 5. Total Score\n\n*   5-1.

Calculate the tip based on the total score and analysis.\n    *   The service level is categorized as Poor due to the customer's negative experience.\n    *   In the USA, casual dining, the Poor range is 0-5%. The customer's reaction (giving a 0% tip) confirms a negative experience. There is no information from google reviews.\n    *   The tip is 0% because of the customer's negative perception of the service.\n*   6-2.

They get a beautiful table by a window, watching the beautiful sunset. Place is still empty, piano just starting up, sort of a calm lovely scene. While they’re being seated, one man is intent on the wine list and wants to order before I’ve left the table after my first greeting. So bam, picks out a decent $80 cab for the table and I signal to to my back waiter to switch out glassware while I head down into the cellar for the bottle. I come up and go through the pouring, tasting and then serve each guest. As soon as I put the bottle down the man takes it and empties it among the four glasses. So each of them has a red wine glass that is super full and everyone at the table is clearly not amused. I watch as the man chugs his glass in a desperate series of gulps. His wife is saying his name quietly while the other couple just sit awkwardly with their fifty gallon wine glasses trying to sip them without spilling. \n\nSo I come back to see if they are ready to order. Everyone is, but the man wants to start with another bottle. I sort of agree, noting everyone’s glass is full but his. Everyone orders food and he mentions the second bottle and I ask if we should wait for the food or bring it straight away. The wife suddenly blurts, “Robert you’re an alcoholic.” The man immediately gets red in the face and doubles down on the order. “We’ll take the second bottle now.” Then the other woman looks up at me and says “He drove us here. If you serve him he will be putting our lives at risk.”  Then the other man just says flatly “our lives are in your hands.” At this point Robert the alcoholic is about to blow a gasket, his face is purple and he’s sputtering. I just pick up the wine list and channel my best black jack dealer and say “I apologize but I am not serving anymore alcohol at this table.” Robert slams his butter knife into the table making a ruckus but his wife kind of calms him down. \n\nThey ate three courses. Totally silent the entire time. They didn’t say a word to each other or anyone. It was like stepping into the family dinner of an abusive home. The tension was unbelievable. In the end, they let Bob the alcoholic pay and he tipped me zero on $400. \n\nBut hey, I saved their lives.\n\nEDIT: no, the sun does not dip into the ocean in Maine. I grew up there but lived out west long enough to get mixed up in my descriptions. We still have nice sunsets however.\n\nEDIT: thank you for the awards! \n\nNOTE TO PEOPLE TALKING ABOUT WINE POURS: Pouring over a couple ounces in a glass at a table will get you a talking to at most fine dining places. I would even argue that the “6oz pour” that some of you say is “normal” is actually ridiculous even at your local Applebee’s. 4-5oz, maybe. \n\nQuartering out a bottle of wine on the first pour at a table, leaving an empty bottle, is absolutely not part of good service.",

In the end, they let Bob the alcoholic pay and he tipped me zero on 400. But hey, I saved their lives. EDIT: no, the sun does not dip into the ocean in Maine. I grew up there but lived out west long enough to get mixed up in my descriptions. We still have nice sunsets however. EDIT: thank you for the awards! NOTE TO PEOPLE TALKING ABOUT WINE POURS: Pouring over a couple ounces in a glass at a table will get you a talking to at most fine dining places. I would even argue that the 6oz pour that some of you say is normal is actually ridiculous even at your local Applebee s. 4 5oz, maybe. Quartering out a bottle of wine on the first pour at a table, leaving an empty bottle, is absolutely not part of good service.\n\n### Video Caption ###\nThe server greeted the table and promptly handled the initial wine order, including signaling for glassware change and performing the pouring ritual.

    "text_content": "Back when I worked as a server at a certain franchised pizzeria/restaurant (12 years ago), there was one table everyone hated. It was a man in probably his 60s and his mother in her 80s-90s. They were very particular, asked only for glasses of ice (they brought their own soda), bad tippers, and were quite surly. I always had a policy for the worst tables: kill them with kindness. Always polite, always smiling, always joking (even if they didn’t laugh).  \n\nMy first encounter with these guests, they had been coming to the restaurant once a month for about 8-9 months. They walked in, and the other waitstaff groaned, and rolled their eyes. When they were sat in their usual table, it happened to be in my section for the day. The host apologized to me, the other waitstaff looked at me with pity, and I took a deep breath and put my best smile on. They were curt during my greeting, and ordered their glasses of ice with an air of demand. We all knew they brought in their own soda. But the GM still let them come in. Throughout the rest of this first time, I made sure to sparkle, and by the end, they had warmed up a bit. The tip wasn’t great, but I didn’t expect it to be.  \n\nThe next time Mom and Son came in, they requested me. Their usual table wasn’t in my section, but the server in that section gladly let me take it, and I gave her a table in my section to make up for it. They were all smiles when I approached the table, but still left the same meager tip.  \n\nThey came in and requested me monthly for the next 2 years I worked there (until my oldest son was born and I left to take care of him). In that time, I get to know them and learned that the son was living off a small amount of money monthly, but still took his mother out for lunch every month. The soda they brought in was diet orange, the only kind Mom really liked and could drink (and we didn’t have). They were sweet, kind, and loving, and all it took was someone treating them with kindness and joy a couple times for them to open up.  \n\nThey were the table everyone hates, and the tip was awful, but they were my favorite. I’m sure the mother has passed by now, but I hope that the son thinks back and remembers those lunch dates with her and thinks of me as fondly as I do of them.",

It was a man in probably his 60s and his mother in her 80s 90s. They were very particular, asked only for glasses of ice they brought their own soda , bad tippers, and were quite surly. I always had a policy for the worst tables: kill them with kindness. Always polite, always smiling, always joking even if they didn t laugh . My first encounter with these guests, they had been coming to the restaurant once a month for about 8 9 months. They walked in, and the other waitstaff groaned, and rolled their eyes. When they were sat in their usual table, it happened to be in my section for the day. The host apologized to me, the other waitstaff looked at me with pity, and I took a deep breath and put my best smile on. They were curt during my greeting, and ordered their glasses of ice with an air of demand. We all knew they brought in their own soda. But the GM still let them come in. Throughout the rest of this first time, I made sure to sparkle, and by the end, they had warmed up a bit. The tip wasn t great, but I didn t expect it to be. The next time Mom and Son came in, they requested me. Their usual table wasn t in my section, but the server in that section gladly let me take it, and I gave her a table in my section to make up for it. They were all smiles when I approached the table, but still left the same meager tip. They came in and requested me monthly for the next 2 years I worked there until my oldest son was born and I left to take care of him . In that time, I get to know them and learned that the son was living off a small amount of money monthly, but still took his mother out for lunch every month. The soda they brought in was diet orange, the only kind Mom really liked and could drink and we didn t have . They were sweet, kind, and loving, and all it took was someone treating them with kindness and joy a couple times for them to open up. They were the table everyone hates, and the tip was awful, but they were my favorite. I m sure the mother has passed by now, but I hope that the son thinks back and remembers those lunch dates with her and thinks of me as fondly as I do of them.\n\n### Video Caption ###\nThe server consistently maintained a polite, smiling, and positive attitude, applying a \"kill them with kindness\" approach. They proactively engaged with the customers over multiple visits, learning specific details about their preferences. This effort led to the customers requesting the server for subsequent visits.\n\n### User Input ###\n    1. Country: USA, Type: Casual dining\n    2. Restaurant name: Gold Spoon\n    3.

Nancy Kerrigan got clubbed in the foot by Tonya Harding s boyfriend. Kurt Cobain committed suicide at his home in Seattle. And I got a job waiting tables at the Olive Garden in North Miami Beach. It was my second in what would become a string table waiting spats. Anyway some background: When you start new as a waiter or waitress at a restaurant they usually stick you with the crummiest most not profitable shift otherwise known as LUNCH But if you re Adam and Eveing it with the manager your schedule can change pretty quickly. Problem was the manager was a guy. And Brokeback Mountain wasn t out yet. Neither was I. So I worked lunch. It was HORRIBLE. For starters Olive Garden had this lunch special at the time where for just 2.99 you get unlimited soup and salad as a meal! Do you know what unlimited means? It means the waiter me has to run back and forth to an inferno of a kitchen refilling your soup and salad 1000 times. And I don t know if they still do this at the O.G. now the place sounds like a series on FOX but when I was there they had fresh grated cheese. You know what fresh grated cheese means? It means the waiter me again has to stand there feverishly turning some tiny cheese grating knob a million miles an hour so some miniscule flecks of cheese can snowflake themselves onto your plate. You think most people were happy with snowflakes.? No they weren t. They didn t want snowflakes they wanted a freaking blizzard! So by the time I was through grating cheese for a table of five I lost feeling in my arm. Oh and by the way I was 100 pounds over weight. So there you have fat me running in and out of Hell s kitchen Sylvester Staloneing my right arm grating cheese panting like a purse snatcher. Oh and I was sweating probably more than Dick Cheney s rifle instructor. Bullets of perspiration were perpetually niagra falling down my face. It was AWEFUL. But it did help with tips. My table s thought I was working hard so they always gave more than 20 Heck even other waiter s tables threw me a couple bucks every now and then cause they felt sorry for me. As for management They called me bullets though I d never shot a gun.\n\n### Video Caption ###\nThe server frequently ran back and forth to refill unlimited soup and salad orders.

The server was able to explain the lunch special and the process of grating cheese, demonstrating sufficient knowledge of the menu and service procedures, but there's no indication of exceptional confidence or upselling.\n    d) Empathy: 3.

Offering to involve a manager or comp a meal demonstrates a high level of responsiveness to customer needs and complaints.\n*   **c) Assurance:** 4 - The server maintained a professional demeanor, offering solutions and handling complaints.\n    *   **Justification:** While the video doesn't explicitly discuss the server's knowledge of the menu, the actions taken (handling complaints, offering solutions) suggest competence and confidence in the service.\n*   **d) Empathy:** 4 - The server's actions in response to complaints suggest an understanding of customer dissatisfaction.\n    *   **Justification:** The server's willingness to offer solutions, potentially comping the meal, indicates an effort to understand and address the customer's negative experience, showing empathy.\n*   **e) Tangibles:** 4 - The video doesn't provide information about tangibles, but given that there are no negative comments, this aspect is considered to be clean and tidy.\n    *   **Justification:** The provided information is insufficient to analyze this field.

I worked doubles Saturday amp; Sunday 12 hours each so you could say I was pretty tired today. We have 4 servers total, and 2 are on vacation right now so i ve been closing alone at night this week my manager stayed to help me a few nights. We don t have a hostess, food runners, or bussers, so when we re busy, I try to get things done as fast as I can. Tonight during a pop I had these two guys dad and son that both went to the bathroom at the same time. I had just put their order in and then started cleaning tables. I wasn t even thinking about it and bussed their drinks and wiped their table. It was really embarrassing. The dad was clearly upset when they came back. They tipped me 10 , but it was understandable. Thankfully, most of my other people were pretty generous tonight. TGIF on a Monday!\n\n### Video Caption ###\nThe server took the customers' order. While the customers were briefly away from their table, the server mistakenly cleared their drinks and wiped down the table, which resulted in the dad being clearly upset upon their return. The server was also responsible for bussing tables due to limited staff.\n\n### User Input ###\n    1. Country: USA, Type: Casual dining\n    2. Restaurant name: Gold Spoon\n    3.

This indicates a lack of attention to detail and potentially incorrect order handling, resulting in a lower score.\n\n    b) Responsiveness: 3\n        The video doesn't show the server's response, but the context implies the server was likely unaware of the customers' needs at the time of the mistake. No immediate response occurred, but the server was likely busy with other tasks due to being understaffed.\n\n    c) Assurance: 3\n        While the video doesn't provide information about the server's menu knowledge or confidence, the incident suggests a lack of attention to customer needs and possibly a lack of experience. However, the server could be new.\n\n    d) Empathy: 2\n        The video shows the server's action, which resulted in a negative customer experience. The server did not appear to consider the customer's feelings or anticipate their needs.\n\n    e) Tangibles: 4\n        The video doesn't offer details on cleanliness. However, the server was cleaning the table. We can assume the table settings were tidy, and cleanliness was maintained.\n\n1-2.

I was walking away from taking two table's orders, after which I was planning on grabbing waters and greeting a new table that had sat down maybe 3 minutes before.Since our restaurant is pretty small, when it gets busy it gets super loud, plus we have a full bar so the customers drinking get pretty loud as well. \n\nAs I'm walking back to input the orders, the father from my new table flags me down as I walk past him and asks who their waiter is. It's a party of three, a mom, dad, and daughter who looked about 16. I look at their table and see he has his phone timer on facing me, thankfully the timer was at 2 minutes, but I could tell they were going to be a fun party. \n\nFather: F\n\nMother: M\n\nMe: I'm actually your server tonight, would you like me to take your order now? \n\nF: Yes, I would like a small cheese pizza\n\nMe: Great, would you like thin crust or deep dish?\n\nF: Thin crust\n\nMe: Okay, and for you? (to the mother)\n\nM: I want gluten free and vegan\n\nMe: Okay, we have a gluten free crust that's the same size as the small thin crust and a vegan cheese option, would you like any toppings on that?\n\nM: What comes on it?\n\nMe: Well you can choose any of our specialty pizzas or you can build your own with any of the toppings on this list (pointing to the list on the menu).\n\nM: But what already comes on it?\n\nMe: So far I just have vegan cheese on it, would you like just cheese on the pizza?\n\nM: Well I don't know, what toppings come on the vegan cheese? \n\nMe: The vegan cheese is just the replacement we use if you want vegan cheese, it doesn't include any toppings. You can choose any of these toppings or one of our specialty pizzas.\n\nM: Oh, so I choose toppings that you add to the pizza?\n\nMe: Yes! (I still have two tables' orders to put in and this conversation has been going on for at least five minutes)\n\nM: okay, what vegetables are vegan?\n\nI'm not even joking, she didn't say what TOPPINGS are vegan, she said VEGETABLES!! I had just gotten back from a table that thought it was funny to mess with me all night (the salad was too small HAHA just kidding, acting offended when I asked if they wanted anything else tonight before handing them the check, etc) so I just stood there and smiled at this lady.\n\nF: Did you just hear yourself? You asked what vegetables are vegan, that doesn't make sense. She's asking what toppings you want!\n\nM: Oh hahaha okay. I will get pepperoni. \n\nI say nothing about the lack of veganness in pepperoni, I am tired and I am not going to repeat this whole thing. \n\nMe: Wonderful! Anything else for you guys?\n\nF: She (the teenage daughter) will have the kids cheese pizza. Actually pepperoni. With bacon. Only bacon actually. Maybe pepperoni and bacon. Actually, no bacon, sorry daughter, maybe next time. \n\nI read back their order, starting with the thin crust the father ordered. \n\nF: Thin crust??? I wanted thick crust! I wouldn't come here for thin crust, I always get thick crust everywhere! \n\nMe: Oh I'm sorry, deep dish. (I clarify deep dish and not thick crust because those are two different crusts and I don't want this man expecting a fluffy pizza and getting a deep dish... which is not at all fluffy or has a thick crust.) That's cool that you're able to find other good deep dish pizzas, I haven't seen another pizza place in the area with deep dish. (I'm genuinely just trying to be friendly, Chicago deep dish is very uncommon in my area.\n\nHe just stares at me and looks slightly mad that I corrected him from thick crust to deep dish, and that I commented on how he only eats deep dish apparently.\n\nI finish up with them and put their order in, they leave me a 15% tip so that's good, but it was just so weird how bad they were at ordering, plus timing me to see how long it took to greet them was not cool.\n\nEdit: they ordered a salad at first and the father said he wants the cheese on the side because his wife likes the cheese, so lactose intolerant is out of the question.",

Father: F Mother: M Me: I'm actually your server tonight, would you like me to take your order now? F: Yes, I would like a small cheese pizza Me: Great, would you like thin crust or deep dish? F: Thin crust Me: Okay, and for you? to the mother M: I want gluten free and vegan Me: Okay, we have a gluten free crust that's the same size as the small thin crust and a vegan cheese option, would you like any toppings on that? M: What comes on it? Me: Well you can choose any of our specialty pizzas or you can build your own with any of the toppings on this list pointing to the list on the menu . M: But what already comes on it? Me: So far I just have vegan cheese on it, would you like just cheese on the pizza? M: Well I don't know, what toppings come on the vegan cheese? Me: The vegan cheese is just the replacement we use if you want vegan cheese, it doesn't include any toppings. You can choose any of these toppings or one of our specialty pizzas. M: Oh, so I choose toppings that you add to the pizza? Me: Yes! I still have two tables' orders to put in and this conversation has been going on for at least five minutes M: okay, what vegetables are vegan? I'm not even joking, she didn't say what TOPPINGS are vegan, she said VEGETABLES!! I had just gotten back from a table that thought it was funny to mess with me all night the salad was too small HAHA just kidding, acting offended when I asked if they wanted anything else tonight before handing them the check, etc so I just stood there and smiled at this lady. F: Did you just hear yourself? You asked what vegetables are vegan, that doesn't make sense. She's asking what toppings you want! M: Oh hahaha okay. I will get pepperoni. I say nothing about the lack of veganness in pepperoni, I am tired and I am not going to repeat this whole thing. Me: Wonderful! Anything else for you guys? F: She the teenage daughter will have the kids cheese pizza. Actually pepperoni. With bacon. Only bacon actually. Maybe pepperoni and bacon. Actually, no bacon, sorry daughter, maybe next time. I read back their order, starting with the thin crust the father ordered. F: Thin crust??? I wanted thick crust! I wouldn't come here for thin crust, I always get thick crust everywhere! Me: Oh I'm sorry, deep dish. I clarify deep dish and not thick crust because those are two different crusts and I don't want this man expecting a fluffy pizza and getting a deep dish... which is not at all fluffy or has a thick crust. That's cool that you're able to find other good deep dish pizzas, I haven't seen another pizza place in the area with deep dish. I'm genuinely just trying to be friendly, Chicago deep dish is very uncommon in my area. He just stares at me and looks slightly mad that I corrected him from thick crust to deep dish, and that I commented on how he only eats deep dish apparently. I finish up with them and put their order in, they leave me a 15 tip so that's good, but it was just so weird how bad they were at ordering, plus timing me to see how long it took to greet them was not cool. Edit: they ordered a salad at first and the father said he wants the cheese on the side because his wife likes the cheese, so lactose intolerant is out of the question.\n\n### Video Caption ###\nThe server was walking past a new table when flagged down and immediately identified self, offering to take their order.

Video Evaluation Criteria\n    a) Reliability: 3 - The server made a mistake in the order, but it was quickly corrected.\n        *Reason: The server correctly took and submitted the order. However, the father changed the order, which the server then corrected. There was some initial confusion with the crust type, but it was quickly rectified.*\n    b) Responsiveness: 5 - The server immediately responded to the customer's request.\n        *Reason: The server immediately responded to the customer flagging them down, showing a high level of attentiveness.*\n    c) Assurance: 4 - The server was confident in their handling of the order, even when answering questions, and provided professional explanations.\n        *Reason: The server explained the menu options and offered clarification.

It's very rare that I recognize any guests except for the regulars that I adore. Surprising, I never recognize any of the terrible customers that I get... But maybe that's for the best. Well there is this family of 5 that have now come in for the fourth time and they make it really difficult to forget their faces once they leave...\n\nI don't know what it is, but it seems like every time they come in, they are sat in my section. Not a server or any other employee recognizes them but me... So this is how I know I'm the lucky one to get them EVERY TIME!! This family is very snooty, won't look at you as your talking to them, one word answers, huge tab blowers, don't want to pay for their whole bill, and very shitty tippers. Tonight was the last night for this game!\n\nI gave them a very nice greeting like any other guest I have, they ordered, I brought them their food, checked on them a few times, and then they tell me they didn't like their $60 worth of food that they ate all of. Now I knew exactly what they were going to do before they even ordered and I was prepared for it... But tonight, I wasn't going to go out of my way to comp $60 worth of food just out of the kindness of my hart and hope they tip. The last three times they have come in, I have at least comped over $200 worth of food for them and I just cannot enable this kind of behavior anymore. I give them the appropriate amount of time to tell me they don't like their food so that way I can replace it with something else.. EVERY TIME they tell me they are fine until they get their bill and tell me they didn't like their food. This time when they told me they didn't like what they had, I simply asked them why they didn't tell me they didn't like their food during the 3 times I checked on them. No answer. I apologized and recommended something else for them to try during their NEXT visit. So when I brought them the bill, they realized that I didn't comp or void anything off their bill.  They call me over, and mind you, this is the first time I have actually gotten a full sentence out of them, as they are asking why they should pay for something they didn't like. I explained to them that it seemed that they did like what they ate because they ATE ALL OF IT! It's against company policy to not charge for something that was completely eaten and claimed for.... Which it is. I also explained to them that during their stay they should have told me they weren't satisfied during the times I checked on them so that way i could have accommodated with something they would be more satisfied with. They paid their tab, the WHOLE tab this time, but also left me a little note about how bad of a server I was and that they will not be coming back. And of course, no tip as usual. ",

It's very rare that I recognize any guests except for the regulars that I adore. Surprising, I never recognize any of the terrible customers that I get... But maybe that's for the best. Well there is this family of 5 that have now come in for the fourth time and they make it really difficult to forget their faces once they leave... I don't know what it is, but it seems like every time they come in, they are sat in my section. Not a server or any other employee recognizes them but me... So this is how I know I'm the lucky one to get them EVERY TIME!! This family is very snooty, won't look at you as your talking to them, one word answers, huge tab blowers, don't want to pay for their whole bill, and very shitty tippers. Tonight was the last night for this game! I gave them a very nice greeting like any other guest I have, they ordered, I brought them their food, checked on them a few times, and then they tell me they didn't like their 60 worth of food that they ate all of. Now I knew exactly what they were going to do before they even ordered and I was prepared for it... But tonight, I wasn't going to go out of my way to comp 60 worth of food just out of the kindness of my hart and hope they tip. The last three times they have come in, I have at least comped over 200 worth of food for them and I just cannot enable this kind of behavior anymore. I give them the appropriate amount of time to tell me they don't like their food so that way I can replace it with something else.. EVERY TIME they tell me they are fine until they get their bill and tell me they didn't like their food. This time when they told me they didn't like what they had, I simply asked them why they didn't tell me they didn't like their food during the 3 times I checked on them. No answer. I apologized and recommended something else for them to try during their NEXT visit. So when I brought them the bill, they realized that I didn't comp or void anything off their bill. They call me over, and mind you, this is the first time I have actually gotten a full sentence out of them, as they are asking why they should pay for something they didn't like. I explained to them that it seemed that they did like what they ate because they ATE ALL OF IT! It's against company policy to not charge for something that was completely eaten and claimed for.... Which it is. I also explained to them that during their stay they should have told me they weren't satisfied during the times I checked on them so that way i could have accommodated with something they would be more satisfied with. They paid their tab, the WHOLE tab this time, but also left me a little note about how bad of a server I was and that they will not be coming back. And of course, no tip as usual.\n\n### Video Caption ###\nThe server provided a greeting, took the order, delivered food, and checked on the table three times during the meal.

RIGHT??\"  Forehead slap.\n\nThese fricking people.  First of all, church people are the shittiest tippers.  Not every one of them, but on average?  Yeah, they suck hairy balls.  Sorry if you are a church person who tips well.  \n\nThey always seemed to start with an 8-top.  That turns into a 12-top.  That becomes a 20-top.  You get the drift.  A nebulous head count that doubles and triples in size like an amoeba on steroids.\n\nYou'd start at one end of the table and take drink orders; while dropping the drinks before you can even get to the end of the table there'd be a crotch spawn rattling their ice at you.  How the hell can a 6-year-old slurp down 20oz in 2 minutes?\n\nThe people who show up at 1:45 and when you tell them the buffet is about to be closed down, they say \"no problem, we'll be fast!\"  And then cue hissy fit when they realize that 'close down' means food is removed and goes bye-bye into the nether regions of the kitchen.\n\nSeparate fucking checks.  Ohmigod.  Mom and Dad:  \"It's the two of us plus the red head and the twins with the suspenders.\"  Meanwhile it's like musical chairs, except instead of one less chair per people, there are 6 extra chairs and people moving every 30 seconds.\n\nFinally, you know how after a tornado hits a small town and all that is left are twisted gnarled trees and concrete pads and detritus strewn all over the ground?  Picture the scene after a locust swarm 20-top with 12 kids heads out the door.  Check for $200?  Lucky if the tip is $10 - and you get to spend 20 minutes cleaning up.\n\nRant over.  So, so glad I'm out of the server life.  I can't imagine how painful it must be with today's entitlement.",

The people who show up at 1:45 and when you tell them the buffet is about to be closed down, they say \"no problem, we'll be fast!\" And then cue hissy fit when they realize that 'close down' means food is removed and goes bye bye into the nether regions of the kitchen. Separate fucking checks. Ohmigod. Mom and Dad: \"It's the two of us plus the red head and the twins with the suspenders.\" Meanwhile it's like musical chairs, except instead of one less chair per people, there are 6 extra chairs and people moving every 30 seconds. Finally, you know how after a tornado hits a small town and all that is left are twisted gnarled trees and concrete pads and detritus strewn all over the ground? Picture the scene after a locust swarm 20 top with 12 kids heads out the door. Check for 200? Lucky if the tip is 10 and you get to spend 20 minutes cleaning up. Rant over. So, so glad I'm out of the server life. I can't imagine how painful it must be with today's entitlement.\n\n### Video Caption ###\nThe server's tasks included seating guests, keeping drinks filled, pre-bussing plates, taking and delivering drink orders, managing late arrivals near closing, handling complex separate checks, and performing extensive cleanup. The environment presented challenges such as rapidly changing large group sizes, fast drink consumption, unclear headcount, and difficult check splitting.\n\n### User Input ###\n    1.

    "response": "Okay, I'm ready to analyze the situation and calculate the appropriate tip. Here's my breakdown based on the provided information:\n\n**1. Video Caption Analysis**\n\nThe video caption describes the server's tasks and the challenging environment. The key issues are:\n\n*   **Complexities:** Handling large, fluctuating group sizes, fast drink consumption, and difficult check splitting.\n*   **Time constraints:** Dealing with late arrivals and the impending close of the buffet.\n*   **Cleanup:** Extensive cleanup required.\n\n**1-1. Video Evaluation Criteria**\n\nLet's score the video based on the criteria:\n\n*   **a) Reliability:** 3 - The caption doesn't suggest many order mistakes, but it highlights the challenges of managing a busy buffet and potential for errors with large groups and complex check splitting. However, there is no direct evidence of consistent mistakes.\n    *Reasoning:* The caption focuses on systemic challenges rather than specific errors.\n*   **b) Responsiveness:** 3 - The caption doesn't explicitly mention responsiveness, but the context implies the server is likely dealing with multiple demands at once, possibly leading to average response times.\n    *Reasoning:* The sheer volume of tasks suggests a potentially average response time.\n*   **c) Assurance:** 3 - The caption doesn't give specifics on how the server handles menu questions. However, because the context is buffet style, this is not a primary concern.\n    *Reasoning:* Not applicable.\n*   **d) Empathy:** 3 - The caption suggests the server is probably trying to provide service, though not particularly personalized.\n    *Reasoning:* There are no indications of proactive understanding or exceptional service.\n*   **e) Tangibles:** 4 - The caption implies an environment that is clean but may be affected by the large volume of traffic at the buffet.\n    *Reasoning:* The server is mentioned as needing to clean up, thus implying the area is mostly clean.\n\n**1-2. Video Score Calculation**\n\nVideo Score = (3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 4) \\* 4 = 64\n\n**5. Total Score**\n\n**5-1. Total Score Calculation**\n\nTotal Score = Video Score = 64\n\n**6. Tip Calculation**\n\n**6-1. Calculate the tip based on the total score and analysis.**\n\n*   **Service Level:** Based on the video score of 64, the service level is considered \"Normal\".\n\n*   **Tipping Percentage:**\n    *   Country: USA\n    *   Restaurant Type: Casual dining\n    *   Normal range: \\[6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15]%\n*   **Review Context:** The Reddit post expresses frustration with the customers.\n*   **Final Tip Percentage:** With the issues described in the Reddit post, I will choose a tip percentage that is on the lower side. Thus, it will be at 7%\n\n*   **Tip Amount Calculation:**\n\n    Subtotal: $25.00\n    Tip Percentage: 7%\n    Tip Amount = $25.00 \\* 0.07 = $1.75\n    Total Bill = $25.00 + $1.75 = $26.75\n\n**6-2.

Video Evaluation Criteria\n\n*   **a) Reliability:** 3 - Mostly accurate orders, occasional lack of confirmation.\n    *   **Justification:** The video description doesn't mention any order mistakes, so the reliability should be high. However, the narrative focuses on check splitting and customer interactions, it does not have any evidence of orders and confirmations.\n*   **b) Responsiveness:** 3 - Average response speed, acceptable performance.\n    *   **Justification:** The server was responsive to the initial check-splitting request, but the subsequent actions and the Karen's complaint indicate some delay in returning the cards. This situation is not that the server is slow; rather, there are issues such as high demand, and a process to close out the check. However, due to the high demand, the server handled the situation with the expectation of an acceptable performance.\n*   **c) Assurance:** 3 - Can explain the menu but lacks confidence.\n    *   **Justification:** The server explained the check-splitting situation, but the defensive response to the complaint about card-holding time suggests a lack of confidence in handling the situation. The server was confident, yet his actions could be considered as unconfident.\n*   **d) Empathy:** 3 - Basic friendliness but lacks personalization.\n    *   **Justification:** The server offered to split the check, but the personalized note \"lt;3 Princess Pacexmaker\" seems sarcastic and counterproductive. It indicates an attempt at some form of personalization, but it was not a friendly one.\n*   **e) Tangibles:** Not applicable to the video content.

Had to have at least half my party, and we had a two-hour time limit. Okay. But if it's a two-hour time limit, our waitperson(s) need to be on the ball. \n\nAnd they were. This is not surprising, as this is the only barbeque restaurant I frequent, and it is fabulously staffed. About an hour or so in, I dig in to my mashed potatoes--and pull out a piece of plastic. I also found a hair in the plate, but figured that was either mine or my fiancé's, as we both have long hair. But the plastic? No. No, that wasn't mine. \n\nSeveral people were horrified to see me pull out a rather large piece of plastic. I was grossed out, but I know what horrible customers are like, so all I kept saying was, \"I'm not gonna scream.\" I walked over to the bar where the manager was, and discreetly handed him the mashed potato-covered plastic, in a napkin. I told him, \"I found this in my mashed potatoes. And that's gross. Can I please have new mashed potatoes?\" He ushered me back to my table, apologizing for the mishap.\n\nOur waitress (a super-duper girl I'm going to applaud on Yelp) said the manager comped my meal. I felt bad, because I ate my food, it was delicious, I just wanted new potatoes. But I said thank you, I was very appreciative. And I never did get a new bowl of potatoes.\n\nBTW: In case anybody was wondering, because it was a large party, everyone was given the 18% grat on their bill, which everyone paid--and then tipped over, because our waitress was awesome.",

We went to a Southern barbeque place in Cerritos. Yummy. The restaurant's parametres'? Had to have at least half my party, and we had a two hour time limit. Okay. But if it's a two hour time limit, our waitperson s need to be on the ball. And they were. This is not surprising, as this is the only barbeque restaurant I frequent, and it is fabulously staffed. About an hour or so in, I dig in to my mashed potatoes and pull out a piece of plastic. I also found a hair in the plate, but figured that was either mine or my fiancé's, as we both have long hair. But the plastic? No. No, that wasn't mine. Several people were horrified to see me pull out a rather large piece of plastic. I was grossed out, but I know what horrible customers are like, so all I kept saying was, \"I'm not gonna scream.\" I walked over to the bar where the manager was, and discreetly handed him the mashed potato covered plastic, in a napkin. I told him, \"I found this in my mashed potatoes. And that's gross. Can I please have new mashed potatoes?\" He ushered me back to my table, apologizing for the mishap. Our waitress a super duper girl I'm going to applaud on Yelp said the manager comped my meal. I felt bad, because I ate my food, it was delicious, I just wanted new potatoes. But I said thank you, I was very appreciative. And I never did get a new bowl of potatoes. BTW: In case anybody was wondering, because it was a large party, everyone was given the 18 grat on their bill, which everyone paid and then tipped over, because our waitress was awesome.\n\n### Video Caption ###\nThe waitstaff was described as being 'on the ball' and the restaurant as 'fabulously staffed', suggesting attentiveness. The waitress communicated that the manager had comped the customer's meal following a food issue. However, a replacement order of mashed potatoes was not delivered by the server.\n\n### User Input ###\n    1. Country: USA, Type: Casual dining\n    2. Restaurant name: Gold Spoon\n    3.

    "response": "Here's the analysis and tip calculation based on the provided information:\n\n### Video Caption Analysis\nThe video caption describes a positive experience with the waitstaff being attentive and the restaurant being well-staffed. However, there was a significant issue with the food (plastic in the mashed potatoes), which the manager addressed by comping the meal. The waitress was \"super duper girl,\" according to the user. Despite the food issue, the waitress was well-received and the customer had a positive experience with the staff.\n\n**1-1. Video Evaluation Criteria**\n\n*   **a) Reliability:**\n    *   **Score: 3**\n    *   **Reason:** While the waitress and staff were attentive, there was a clear issue with the food quality (plastic in mashed potatoes), indicating a lapse in reliability. The order was not completely accurate since the mashed potatoes contained foreign objects, but the manager quickly attempted to rectify the situation by comping the meal.\n*   **b) Responsiveness:**\n    *   **Score: 4**\n    *   **Reason:** The waitress and the manager were responsive to the customer's complaint about the plastic. The waitress quickly communicated the manager's solution.\n*   **c) Assurance:**\n    *   **Score: 4**\n    *   **Reason:** The waitress and the manager, while dealing with a significant issue in the food, displayed a professional response in their communication. They handled the situation with assurance, by comping the meal.\n*   **d) Empathy:**\n    *   **Score: 4**\n    *   **Reason:** The waitress showed empathy by recognizing the customer's grossed out reaction and the manager by offering a solution. The waitress was later applauded on Yelp which showed a more personal relationship.\n*   **e) Tangibles:**\n    *   **Score: 3**\n    *   **Reason:** The presence of plastic in the food indicates a failure in maintaining cleanliness at the FDA Food Code standards, which would affect the score. However, overall the cleanliness and other tangibles can be assumed as acceptable because the customer returned, ate most of the food, and complimented the waitress.\n\n**1-2. Video Score Calculation**\nVideo Score = (3 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 3) \\* 4 = 72\nSince the maximum score is 100, the correct formula will be: (3 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 3) \\* 4 = 72 / 5 = 14.4. Since the result should be an integer, the result will be 14.\n\n**5. Total Score**\n**5-1. Total Score Calculation**\nTotal Score = Video Score = 14\n\n**6. Tip Calculation**\n**6-1. Calculate the tip based on the total score and analysis.**\n*   **Service Level:** Normal (14 falls within the Normal range for USA Casual dining: [6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15]%)\n*   **Tipping Percentage:** The waitress was \"awesome\" according to the review, but there was a major issue with the food. Since the customer's experience was overall positive despite the error, and the waitress was applauded, I'll use the upper end of the \"Normal\" range.\n    *   Tipping Percentage = 15%\n\n**6-2.

    "text_content": "This happened earlier this week. I work for a small mom and pop store with table service and damn good food. We used to be open 6 days a week, but as of this week we are now open 7 days a week. Usually when we make changes to the hours, it takes a while for people to pick up on it and it's generally VERY slow to start, so the owner put me as the solo server, with one cook in the kitchen. We have 12 tables as well as a patio, and our tickets are hand written, we do not have a POS system. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo we open for lunch and immediately get a 8 top. Ok no problem. I get their drinks and orders and in walks a 10 top. Okay I got this. But then, no, I don't got this, because within 20 minutes my entire store was FULL. There was literally a new ticket coming in to the kitchen every 2 minutes. Soon we go on a wait, and people begin sitting outside. I'm struggling to keep up, get all the drinks out, all the orders in, running food. As people piled in I started warning tables that all the food is cooked to order and this was the first day we were open this day, so we only had one person in front and one in back, people seem understanding. But then I have to start adding up tickets (by hand). Guess who is all separate checks? The 8 top. And also the 10 top. I'm SCREWED. Drinks are going un-refilled, one of my poor outside tables doesn't even have menus yet, food isn't getting run, there's a wait but tables aren't getting bussed. I'm deep deep deep into the jungle, not just the weeds, trying to turn an entire restaurant over at the same time. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe had called for another server to come in, she was scheduled at 1 and she said she'd come right away, but didn't actually show up until her scheduled start time. Overall the guests were cool because they saw that I was running my ass off and apologizing and thanking people for their understanding like mad. Nobody could have pulled this off, it was NUTS. So I get a good amount of the tables turned over, and I deliver the check to a 2 top of late fifty-year-old Karens who have the same generous apple figure and the same Karen haircut. Separate checks of course. So I go back and separate them, one card and one cash. I bring their payments back and apparently I messed up. I accidentally charged the card for the cash total and vice versa. It happens, it's easy to fix. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut no. Karen doesn't want me to fix it. My store owner is standing by the card machine, I point him out and again reiterate how easily we can fix it. No. She tells me that when I ran their food, I also gave her the other Karen's food, and I gave the other Karen her food. Whoops, that happens sometimes, I am usually pretty good at remembering who had what. But when I'm solo on a packed store/patio and a wait that all came in at the same damn time, I couldn't even tell you what your whole table ordered. I was flying by the seat of my pants lady. She said it showed that I wasn't paying attention. I start to protest and explain how it was our first day open this day and we thought it'd be slow and I was doing my absolute best to keep up, but nobody would have been able to do it better. Karen informs me that I don't need to explain myself to her. She's run plenty of restaurants, and I simply wasn't.paying.attention. Ok Karen. I apologize again and again, offer again to fix the charge. Nope. She sensed weakness and had the chance to be kind. But she had to tear down the last little shred of whatever it was that was holding me together at that point. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have a strong sense of justice and despite my best efforts, I freaking cry when I feel like I've been wronged. I felt tears welling up as I justified myself to her but held them back. The restaurant had emptied out, and my coworker had shown up. My store owner told me I had just done the impossible by running the entire front of house through that shit. But I looked at the mess of tickets, card receipts, and cash at my station and I just lost it. Burst into tears and couldn't stop crying for like 15 minutes, and I'm cry-laughing, my coworkers are shocked/concerned because I didn't want to be crying and I was just overwhelmed by the rush and hurt by a bitchy Karen. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAny other day I could have laughed off the criticism, knowing I really do try my very best and the store owner knows that. I'm damn good at this job and I actually care. But that day, that Karen saw my weakness. She could have responded with empathy but chose to cut me down and it worked. I'm just glad that she didn't see me cry. And I call bullshit on her having managed restaurants, or she'd have been able to see how hard I was trying and that I was flying solo in a really busy store. Oh, and Karen and Karen tipped me a dollar each on a $30 ticket. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: Stressed solo server on a completely full store, Karen senses weakness and destroys server instead of being kind.

I work for a small mom and pop store with table service and damn good food. We used to be open 6 days a week, but as of this week we are now open 7 days a week. Usually when we make changes to the hours, it takes a while for people to pick up on it and it's generally VERY slow to start, so the owner put me as the solo server, with one cook in the kitchen. We have 12 tables as well as a patio, and our tickets are hand written, we do not have a POS system. amp; x200B; So we open for lunch and immediately get a 8 top. Ok no problem. I get their drinks and orders and in walks a 10 top. Okay I got this. But then, no, I don't got this, because within 20 minutes my entire store was FULL. There was literally a new ticket coming in to the kitchen every 2 minutes. Soon we go on a wait, and people begin sitting outside. I'm struggling to keep up, get all the drinks out, all the orders in, running food. As people piled in I started warning tables that all the food is cooked to order and this was the first day we were open this day, so we only had one person in front and one in back, people seem understanding. But then I have to start adding up tickets by hand . Guess who is all separate checks? The 8 top. And also the 10 top. I'm SCREWED. Drinks are going un refilled, one of my poor outside tables doesn't even have menus yet, food isn't getting run, there's a wait but tables aren't getting bussed. I'm deep deep deep into the jungle, not just the weeds, trying to turn an entire restaurant over at the same time. amp; x200B; We had called for another server to come in, she was scheduled at 1 and she said she'd come right away, but didn't actually show up until her scheduled start time. Overall the guests were cool because they saw that I was running my ass off and apologizing and thanking people for their understanding like mad. Nobody could have pulled this off, it was NUTS. So I get a good amount of the tables turned over, and I deliver the check to a 2 top of late fifty year old Karens who have the same generous apple figure and the same Karen haircut. Separate checks of course. So I go back and separate them, one card and one cash. I bring their payments back and apparently I messed up. I accidentally charged the card for the cash total and vice versa. It happens, it's easy to fix. amp; x200B; But no. Karen doesn't want me to fix it. My store owner is standing by the card machine, I point him out and again reiterate how easily we can fix it. No. She tells me that when I ran their food, I also gave her the other Karen's food, and I gave the other Karen her food. Whoops, that happens sometimes, I am usually pretty good at remembering who had what. But when I'm solo on a packed store patio and a wait that all came in at the same damn time, I couldn't even tell you what your whole table ordered. I was flying by the seat of my pants lady. She said it showed that I wasn't paying attention. I start to protest and explain how it was our first day open this day and we thought it'd be slow and I was doing my absolute best to keep up, but nobody would have been able to do it better. Karen informs me that I don't need to explain myself to her. She's run plenty of restaurants, and I simply wasn't.paying.attention. Ok Karen. I apologize again and again, offer again to fix the charge. Nope. She sensed weakness and had the chance to be kind. But she had to tear down the last little shred of whatever it was that was holding me together at that point. amp; x200B; I have a strong sense of justice and despite my best efforts, I freaking cry when I feel like I've been wronged. I felt tears welling up as I justified myself to her but held them back. The restaurant had emptied out, and my coworker had shown up. My store owner told me I had just done the impossible by running the entire front of house through that shit. But I looked at the mess of tickets, card receipts, and cash at my station and I just lost it. Burst into tears and couldn't stop crying for like 15 minutes, and I'm cry laughing, my coworkers are shocked concerned because I didn't want to be crying and I was just overwhelmed by the rush and hurt by a bitchy Karen. amp; x200B; Any other day I could have laughed off the criticism, knowing I really do try my very best and the store owner knows that. I'm damn good at this job and I actually care. But that day, that Karen saw my weakness. She could have responded with empathy but chose to cut me down and it worked. I'm just glad that she didn't see me cry. And I call bullshit on her having managed restaurants, or she'd have been able to see how hard I was trying and that I was flying solo in a really busy store. Oh, and Karen and Karen tipped me a dollar each on a 30 ticket. amp; x200B; TLDR: Stressed solo server on a completely full store, Karen senses weakness and destroys server instead of being kind.\n\n### Video Caption ###\nThe solo server struggled significantly with attentiveness and responsiveness due to being overwhelmed, resulting in unfilled drinks and delays in food delivery and bussing.

The caption doesn't specifically mention if the server confirmed the order.\n        *   *Reasoning*: The video caption focuses on the server's interaction with the table and implies accurate handling of the order and drink orders and food.\n    *   **b) Responsiveness:** 5 - Immediate response, friendly tone and facial expressions, proactive problem-solving. The server immediately took over the table to solve the initial mistake.\n        *   *Reasoning*: The server proactively solved the issue of the initial seating error and immediately took over the service.\n    *   **c) Assurance:** 4 - Professional explanations, confident handling. The server was sarcastic throughout the service and didn't have major problems throughout the night.\n        *   *Reasoning*: The server introduced themself, acknowledged the mistake, and continued service.\n    *   **d) Empathy:** 4 - Remembers customer preferences, offers personalized services like birthday events. The server was able to take over the table and get on with the service with sarcasm.\n        *   *Reasoning*: Although the server used sarcasm, they were able to prevent further problems.\n    *   **e) Tangibles:** 4 - Uniform and table settings are tidy, cleanliness maintained. The video caption did not provide information about the tangibles, so assuming the cleanliness of a casual dining restaurant.\n        *   *Reasoning*: The video caption did not give any information regarding tangibles.\n\n2.  **Video Score Calculation:**\n    Video Score = (3 + 5 + 4 + 4 + 4) \\* 4 = 80\n\n3.  **Total Score:**\n    Total Score = 80\n\n4.  **Tip Calculation:**\n\n    *   Service Level: Good (Since 80 is within the Good range of 16-20%)\n    *   Tipping Percentage: USA Casual dining: Good \\[16, 17, 18, 19, 20]%.

    "text_content": "Going to be a decently long post but I really feel compelled to share. For context, I'm a 21-year-old college student. Born and raised in the deep midwest (basically Canada), but I currently go to school in the South, and I serve 2-3 days a week down here.\n\nI've been struggling with mental health issues my entire life, and these past few weeks have really kicked my ass. One thing about depression is the constant feeling of being a burden, of not having value, and just kind of being there floating through life. In the past few weeks, those feelings have been as bad as ever, to the point where a part of me genuinely believes that I'm not really worth anything. The worthlessness obviously isn't true, but it's all too real in my head. I've been scraping by recently, and it's certainly impacted me at work. Anxiety and depression is a parasite, taking any small hold it can on your brain, and latching on harder and tighter, growing by the day until you give in and let it fester. I've had these episodes before, and I've always been able to push through them eventually, but it doesn't make it any less brutal to experience.\n\nBecause of this, I've been a shell of my usual personality at work recently. I'm a veteran there, one of the longest tenured servers on staff, and usually an emotional leader so it's been pretty obvious that something's up. It was to the point that last night my manager was concerned that I was pissed at him. I wasn't. I was just pissed. On the close last night, we were super busy until about two hours before close, but by 9:30 or so we were pretty much finished with closing work and just sitting around waiting for 11 pm.\n\nAt 10:40, a 7-top walked in. Six of them only spoke Spanish, with one woman in the group able to speak a bit of English. I'm a Spanish minor, so I've taken tables in Spanish before, but at this point in the night I was not in a good mindset to do anything besides mop and leave. It wasn't my turn in rotation, but I begrudgingly agreed to take the table, because honestly there was no way anyone else was going to be able to efficiently and competently give them service.\n\nI walked up to them and greeted them in Spanish. As I mentioned, I'm very obviously midwestern. I look like any copy-and-paste business frat bro (not in a frat but I look exactly like every guy in the business school) and I've been told I have a pretty obvious midwestern accent. When I came up and introduced myself in Spanish, they were floored, and then they all got really excited. I told them kitchen closed in 15 minutes, and requested they try and get their orders in quickly before kitchen close. I grabbed them waters, and when I came back, most of them were ready to order. I helped translate the menu for those who weren't, and somehow managed to get all of their orders in three minutes.\n\nI'm definitely not fluent, and there were a couple of translation issues, but I could tell how thrilled they were to be able to order in their native tongue. A couple of the guys excitedly dapped me up when they ordered, and I realized how much they appreciated the fact that they were able to do so.\n\nThe food came out, all correct, and later on they were taking a selfie. I asked if they needed me to take a pic of them, and everyone once again got really excited, telling me I was the best and how much they appreciated me.\n\nThey all were separate checks- no problem. They ate quickly, and I let them know about the auto grat for a large party. I told them in both Spanish and English, because I wanted to make sure that I could communicate clearly that there was no pressure to tip on top.\n\nOn the way out, one of them told me that they had gotten together in the States for a week, and they were all flying back tomorrow. They all were from different countries- Venezuela, Colombia (I could have told you that one, I suck with Colombian accents lmao), Ecuador, basically all over South America. This was the last night they had together, and they thanked me because usually going out to a restaurant is incredibly difficult, but I had made it easy on them. It struck me how I would never see these people again, but I had managed to make a tangible difference in all of their lives. I was only their server, but I managed to help make a memory for a group of friends in what had been their first in-person meetup in years. This was the last thing they all would do together for a long time, and I was able to make a positive impact on their last night together.\n\nThey all tipped cash on top of the 20%- I made sure to let them know they didn't have to, but they told me to keep it, and that I deserved it. They left, and I finished closing, but as I was mopping I realized that that table was the first time in a long time where I had genuinely felt valuable and needed. That night out is the type of random memory that they'd go back and tell their families, how on the last day of the trip some random gringo college student was able to take their orders in their native tongue. My Spanish was by no means perfect, but damn it if it didn't get the job done.\n\nIt's so weird how life works. I didn't want that table. I was really just working to run out the clock so I could go home. And yet, by pure chance, they needed me and I needed them. As I'm writing this, I'm smiling in memory of how I was able to help them out, how nice they were, and the looks on their faces when I walked up and they realized how much easier of a task ordering would be.\n\nI'm not making this post as a celebration of myself. I just work here, man. I did what I had to do. But my table last night truly changed my perspective on my own self-worth, and how even the smallest actions and interactions can make such a big difference in someone's life. So thank you to table 41, because a random group of South Americans were able to rip off the parasite that told me I didn't matter. In half an hour, I went from believing I didn't really matter to joking and talking to a table who really, truly needed me.\n\nBut apparently, not as much as I needed them.\n\nEdit: Comments are taking me out thank you guys",

For context, I'm a 21 year old college student. Born and raised in the deep midwest basically Canada , but I currently go to school in the South, and I serve 2 3 days a week down here. I've been struggling with mental health issues my entire life, and these past few weeks have really kicked my ass. One thing about depression is the constant feeling of being a burden, of not having value, and just kind of being there floating through life. In the past few weeks, those feelings have been as bad as ever, to the point where a part of me genuinely believes that I'm not really worth anything.

    "text_content": "For the back story about this awesome customer, click [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/zlwx3/the_tale_of_the_20_tipper/c65y3lb).\n\nShort version of back story: Brand new Domino's in a rural small town, new customer out of the delivery area gets an exception because she tips $15 minimum even on a small order.\n\nI made several deliveries to this awesome customer over my 6-month career delivering pizza. All of our drivers knew about this customer and at least twice we had to fire drivers for starting fights over who would take it. In this time I was promoted to Assistant Manager and usually only delivered during lunch or on weekends when we got really busy. I still made out pretty well on tips just from that.\n\nThe Tuesday before that year's Super Bowl, we got a call from Mrs. Awesome. They were having a party for the game and wanted us to cater. She spoke with the owner of the store (who was extremely good at his job, he almost always had our backs when customers were being unreasonable) and he cut her a special deal. The actual total on the slip was just shy of $800. At regular price it would have been nearly twice that. As this was the middle of the afternoon, he called me back to his office to discuss the order. We both knew that Sunday would be our busiest day yet and we had *everyone* scheduled to work. Given the size of the order, he realized one driver probably wouldn't be able to do it alone. All of our drivers had compact cars of some sort. He suggested having 2 or 3 drivers split up the order and split the tip. I was the exception to the rule, driving a 1989 Lincoln Town Car. I did some quick math and a brief simulation with empty boxes and realized that if I emptied the trunk, I could take the whole order in one trip. I sold him on this idea by suggesting that all of the drivers would be running around like crazy as it was, and having 3 of them out for extra time to deliver that one order would back everyone else up. \n\nSunday came, and the lunch rush was about normal for a Sunday, with a few more carryout orders than usual. The owner and I started on the pizzas at noon, putting them on a rack so they could all go in the oven as close to delivery time as possible. 3 hours later, the pizzas were ready, the wings were hot and sauced, breadsticks boxed and ready to go, and I had already packed the bottom of my trunk with the crates of 2-liter sodas before we opened that day. Four of us played Pizza Box Tetris loading my car up as quickly as possible, and I was off. I pulled up to their house just before 4, about an hour from kickoff. Guests had already arrived, but they left room for me to get close to the front door. They had a buffet line set up for the pizzas, serving trays with sterno cans for the wings and breadsticks, and a tub of ice for the sodas. I started hauling in the order, and Mrs. Awesome started shuffling things around on the buffet line to make room for more. It only took 40 minutes to get everything set up, and when the last items made it in, Mrs. Awesome handed me an envelope. \n\n\"Please make sure the kids who helped make the pizza get something out of this.\"\n\nI knew the store would be very busy by now, so I thanked her and drove off, not looking at the envelope. When I got back, the owner asked me how it went. I pulled out the envelope and looked inside to find 14 $100 bills, then told him what she said. He said to keep it but give $20 to everyone who helped slice pizzas and load the car. I walked away that night with $500 just from her delivery, and probably $100 more from the other runs I took as halftime approached.\n\nThe next morning, that money went in to the bank. Combined with my tax refund and 3 more weeks of tips, I resigned from Domino's, loaded up my Town Car with everything I could fit inside, and drove off to fulfill a dream. Four days later I was settling in to my new home in Seattle and getting ready for a whole new career line with its own interesting stories. If it hadn't been for that order, I probably would have delayed that move indefinitely.",

    "title": "Golf People are the best",
    "text_content": "(NOTE: EDITED FOR A COUPLE SMALL GRAMMAR CORRECTIONS)\n\nSo for context, in college I worked two jobs; a Pizza restaurant and a grocery store. This story is from the former. I worked for two locations of this same chain of Pizza restaurants (there are about 8 total, it's a local chain), but the particular location I worked in at the time this story took place tended to have a lot of \"Sport\" groups come in from time to time, usually from the local high schools that were nearby or local parks. However, more importantly, we were right down the street from a major Golf Course, where the PGA tours would come through at least once a year. My manager had wanted to try to get some of the golf crowd, but hadn't been successful in previous years. He therefore got the owner's permission to run a 10% discount on the entire meal ticket if you had at least one person wearing a golf course pass lanyard (the ones they give the fans) in your party, and 15% off if the party had a caddie/crew/groundskeeper with ID in it.\n\nSo remember I mentioned we had lots of \"sport groups\" come through? Usually these were ill-behaved, demanding, unpleasant people. The kids or teens would be messy/rowdy and the adults entitled and bratty. Also, it wasn't uncommon they'd come in groups of like 20-30 with no reservations and then complain when they had to wait a long time for seating, and deliberately leave as big a mess as possible for us when they left with little tip, out of spite. When I heard about the discount, which was being heavily advertised locally, I and the other employees were preparing for the worst.\n\nFast forward to the first day of the tournament. It was about two or three PM when it suddenly poured rain for about ten minutes in one of those classic Southeastern-USA pop-up cloudbursts, and the tournament was suspended for a few hours while they waited for the grass to dry afterwards. When the rain started, I heard one of my coworkers say \"Here they come\", and sure enough, soaking wet people in DROVES were coming right towards us from the golf course, waving their course passes. My manager broke out every wet-floor sign and towel that we had, and in minutes our restaurant was slam-packed with soaking-wet golf people leaving little puddles everywhere. We casually asked a few of the customers why people had walked in the complete torrent of rain instead of waiting the short cloudburst out, but the general consensus was they'd been caught unawares with no umbrellas and figured they couldn't get any wetter than they already were.\n\nDespite all this, instead of being cranky or grumpy, they were all extremely nice and apologetic about being wet (some even went to the bathroom and tried to dry off with paper towels, and tried to use napkins to dry their seats and the floor. Some of the guys took off their shirts and wrung them out under the awning before coming in) , and left good tips despite getting the discount. They also ate quickly because they wanted to get back to the course, so we got through them pretty quickly, and no one had to wait too long despite the fact we were overwhelmed with people.  So we all thought, \"That wasn't as bad as it might have been\". Dinner that night was about the same, though drier and with less people since most had already eaten during the rain delay.\n\nFast forward again to the last day of the tournament. (I didn't work the two days in the middle.) I came in during the \"Dead time\" between two PM and four-thirty PM and noticed two things - the floor was GREEN (little grass clippings from the lunch crowd's shoes) and needed to be swept, and the restaurant was very, very hot. We had large pizza ovens that get to 800 degrees or more, and we also had, up until that point, an excellent HVAC system, but it had died. I found my manager frantically trying to get hold of an HVAC person, while the assistant manager had every ceiling fan we owned running at full blast and had run a block away to the hardware store to buy floor fans for the kitchen staff so they didn't overheat. We learned that the landlord only allowed one HVAC company to touch his stuff, and that said company didn't have anyone free to come until the wee hours of the next day.\n\nBy this point, some of our regulars had come in and done an immediate about-turn when they realized it was as hot (if not hotter) inside as it was out, saying they'd come back another time. Fearing the loss of the golf crowd, my manager did something ludicrously desperate, saying \"They'll never go for it, but I'm trying anyway\". At this location, we had a very large patio out back, which had ceiling fans of its own but was very low-ceilinged and had much better air circulation than the lofty-ceilinged interior of the restaurant. My manager had us push all the patio tables together into one long cafeteria-like row, and move every table we could spare outside to make a few more rows until we were at the maximum the fire marshal would allow for the patio. Then the mass of golf people arrived as the tournament had just ended, hungry and ready for a pizza discount. My manager greeted them at the door and made a grand announcement, expecting most of them to turn away, but immediately people swarmed our patio and sat down in rows like a bunch of kids at school lunchtime, saying \"we don't care, this works fine!\" Complete strangers sitting in rows.More regulars came and refused to join the throng, but the golf people loved it/treated it like it was an adventure. It was very tricky serving food that day because of all the tables being in the \"wrong\" places, but we did manage. One party of two grounds-crew men even made  a point of summoning the manager and telling them it was the best pizza they'd ever had in their life. So I reiterate my title point - other sport groups can be jerks, but in my experience, Golf people are awesome.",

This story is from the former. I worked for two locations of this same chain of Pizza restaurants there are about 8 total, it's a local chain , but the particular location I worked in at the time this story took place tended to have a lot of \"Sport\" groups come in from time to time, usually from the local high schools that were nearby or local parks. However, more importantly, we were right down the street from a major Golf Course, where the PGA tours would come through at least once a year. My manager had wanted to try to get some of the golf crowd, but hadn't been successful in previous years. He therefore got the owner's permission to run a 10 discount on the entire meal ticket if you had at least one person wearing a golf course pass lanyard the ones they give the fans in your party, and 15 off if the party had a caddie crew groundskeeper with ID in it. So remember I mentioned we had lots of \"sport groups\" come through? Usually these were ill behaved, demanding, unpleasant people. The kids or teens would be messy rowdy and the adults entitled and bratty. Also, it wasn't uncommon they'd come in groups of like 20 30 with no reservations and then complain when they had to wait a long time for seating, and deliberately leave as big a mess as possible for us when they left with little tip, out of spite. When I heard about the discount, which was being heavily advertised locally, I and the other employees were preparing for the worst. Fast forward to the first day of the tournament. It was about two or three PM when it suddenly poured rain for about ten minutes in one of those classic Southeastern USA pop up cloudbursts, and the tournament was suspended for a few hours while they waited for the grass to dry afterwards. When the rain started, I heard one of my coworkers say \"Here they come\", and sure enough, soaking wet people in DROVES were coming right towards us from the golf course, waving their course passes. My manager broke out every wet floor sign and towel that we had, and in minutes our restaurant was slam packed with soaking wet golf people leaving little puddles everywhere. We casually asked a few of the customers why people had walked in the complete torrent of rain instead of waiting the short cloudburst out, but the general consensus was they'd been caught unawares with no umbrellas and figured they couldn't get any wetter than they already were. Despite all this, instead of being cranky or grumpy, they were all extremely nice and apologetic about being wet some even went to the bathroom and tried to dry off with paper towels, and tried to use napkins to dry their seats and the floor. Some of the guys took off their shirts and wrung them out under the awning before coming in , and left good tips despite getting the discount. They also ate quickly because they wanted to get back to the course, so we got through them pretty quickly, and no one had to wait too long despite the fact we were overwhelmed with people. So we all thought, \"That wasn't as bad as it might have been\". Dinner that night was about the same, though drier and with less people since most had already eaten during the rain delay. Fast forward again to the last day of the tournament. I didn't work the two days in the middle. I came in during the \"Dead time\" between two PM and four thirty PM and noticed two things the floor was GREEN little grass clippings from the lunch crowd's shoes and needed to be swept, and the restaurant was very, very hot. We had large pizza ovens that get to 800 degrees or more, and we also had, up until that point, an excellent HVAC system, but it had died. I found my manager frantically trying to get hold of an HVAC person, while the assistant manager had every ceiling fan we owned running at full blast and had run a block away to the hardware store to buy floor fans for the kitchen staff so they didn't overheat. We learned that the landlord only allowed one HVAC company to touch his stuff, and that said company didn't have anyone free to come until the wee hours of the next day. By this point, some of our regulars had come in and done an immediate about turn when they realized it was as hot if not hotter inside as it was out, saying they'd come back another time. Fearing the loss of the golf crowd, my manager did something ludicrously desperate, saying \"They'll never go for it, but I'm trying anyway\". At this location, we had a very large patio out back, which had ceiling fans of its own but was very low ceilinged and had much better air circulation than the lofty ceilinged interior of the restaurant. My manager had us push all the patio tables together into one long cafeteria like row, and move every table we could spare outside to make a few more rows until we were at the maximum the fire marshal would allow for the patio. Then the mass of golf people arrived as the tournament had just ended, hungry and ready for a pizza discount. My manager greeted them at the door and made a grand announcement, expecting most of them to turn away, but immediately people swarmed our patio and sat down in rows like a bunch of kids at school lunchtime, saying \"we don't care, this works fine!\" Complete strangers sitting in rows.More regulars came and refused to join the throng, but the golf people loved it treated it like it was an adventure. It was very tricky serving food that day because of all the tables being in the \"wrong\" places, but we did manage. One party of two grounds crew men even made a point of summoning the manager and telling them it was the best pizza they'd ever had in their life. So I reiterate my title point other sport groups can be jerks, but in my experience, Golf people are awesome.\n\n### Video Caption ###\nServers efficiently handled a sudden rush of customers, managing orders quickly and minimizing wait times despite being overwhelmed.

AYCE we do not. i’ve heard from the staff who have been there a while we used to be great and never got back to it\n\nso dear customers, don’t expect unrealistic things and get pissy when they don’t go your way. we all know this is a shit show we are not unaware. take it up with the big bosses and not the ppl working their ass off for so little. we aren’t sitting here twiddling our thumbs we are working as best we can. at this point my reward for a busy shift isn’t bigger money, it’s getting out in one piece. this AYCE is a dumbass idea because we’ve had a busier rush than this and done great and had people happy. but it calms down cause it’s one goddamn order. not a million fucking reorders and ppl being there for hours\n\nTL;DR stop being an ass and leave the struggling staff alone. we know it’s bad. don’t take it out on us",

AYCE we do not. i ve heard from the staff who have been there a while we used to be great and never got back to it so dear customers, don t expect unrealistic things and get pissy when they don t go your way. we all know this is a shit show we are not unaware. take it up with the big bosses and not the ppl working their ass off for so little. we aren t sitting here twiddling our thumbs we are working as best we can. at this point my reward for a busy shift isn t bigger money, it s getting out in one piece. this AYCE is a dumbass idea because we ve had a busier rush than this and done great and had people happy. but it calms down cause it s one goddamn order. not a million fucking reorders and ppl being there for hours TL;DR stop being an ass and leave the struggling staff alone. we know it s bad. don t take it out on us\n\n### Video Caption ###\nThe server worked under extreme pressure with a high table ratio (13 tables per server) and limited staff during a peak period.

    "response": "Okay, I will analyze the video caption, evaluate the waiter's performance, and calculate the tip based on the provided information.\n\n**1-1. Video Evaluation Criteria**\n\n*   **a) Reliability:** 3. The video caption indicates service delays (20 minutes for food, 5 minutes for refills). This suggests some order fulfillment issues due to the overwhelming workload but doesn't explicitly mention order mistakes. Therefore, a score of 3 seems appropriate.\n*   **b) Responsiveness:** 3. While the server was \"working intensely,\" the delays described in the caption (20 minutes for food, 5 minutes for refills) indicate a slower response time. This is likely due to the high table ratio and challenging environment, but the responsiveness is affected. The score of 3 indicates average response speed in the context of the extreme circumstances.\n*   **c) Assurance:** 3. The caption mentions the server was attempting to manage the challenging situation. This suggests the server acknowledged the issues. However, there's no indication of confident menu explanations or premium suggestions. A score of 3 is assigned as they are likely capable of explaining but lack confidence.\n*   **d) Empathy:** 3. The server is described as attempting to manage a challenging situation, implying they understand the difficulties. However, there is no mention of personalized services or proactively understanding customer emotions. Therefore, the server is likely capable but it lacks personalization.\n*   **e) Tangibles:** 4. The provided caption does not explicitly mention any tangibles such as the cleanliness of the table, utensils, or uniform. Although a low staff level is mentioned, there is nothing that could negatively impact the service so a score of 4 is given.\n\n**1-2.

Calculate the tip based on the total score and analysis.**\n\n*   Service Level: Based on the video score of 64, the service level is considered \"Normal\".\n*   Tipping Percentage:\n    *   Country: USA\n    *   Restaurant Type: Casual dining\n    *   Tipping range for \"Normal\" service: 6% - 15%\n*   Review Considerations: The user reviews focus on the extreme pressure of the situation, but the server is trying their best. The reviews do not indicate any ethical issues. The final tip percentage will be at the lower end of the \"Normal\" range.\n*   Final Tip Percentage: 6%\n*   Tip Amount Calculation: $25.00 * 0.06 = $1.50\n*   Total Bill: $25.00 + $1.50 = $26.50\n\n**6-2.

I was told not to have my on call come in because they weren’t expecting it to be busy… big mistake. It’s a beautiful day out, we just had the total eclipse happen, and many family’s had the day off for the event. So, it was balls to the wall busy from the get go. Usually, I start turning groups away, especially if they do not have a reservation, because there’s only so many people I can serve even if we have enough tables to seat every single person that walks in (it’s a large restaurant).\n\nThis man walks in and asks for a table for 8. I asked if he had a reservation as I had one reservation for 5:45pm for 7 people, and he lied and took it. They sat in the spot reserved for another group that actually did call. It created such a mess, and when I confronted the group about it, they shrugged their shoulders and said that they always get in without a reservation—not even ACKNOWLEDGING that they stole the reservation from someone else. I didn’t kick them out because they had their drinks and I know my boss would be upset, but it caused such a mess in my service that was already a mess because I was stressed out and alone. \n\nThe table then proceeds to demand that I prioritize their food because they had kids who were hungry… I told them no and that they had to patiently wait like everyone else. They then demanded I do a bunch of modifications for them, such as “have them make my bacon extra crispy” and “no ice in my water”, when I had no time for them and a full restaurant to deal with. \n\nAnyways, they split the bill in two, and they each tipped me $5.00 on their respectful $85.00+ bills and proceeded to chew me out for “being rude” to them… I have never been this angry at a customer before because if anything I did them a massive favour by letting them stay seated when I could’ve kicked them out. They didn’t understand the concept of making a reservation, and nor did they understand that I was completely alone and that their demands were so menial and unnecessary. Moreover, they didn’t take ownership nor understand that taking someone else’s reservation is disrespectful and rude. I wish I could’ve punched them in the face and really gave them a proper piece of my mind, and it really reminds me of how much of a shit job serving can be lol \n\nEDIT: I think people are a bit confused, but I DID in fact ask for the name under the reservation, and the man peered into my book (which unfortunately has big writing) and noticed our one and only reservation for 7 people, thus taking their name. I didn’t seat them without asking for a name, nor give them the details right after they simply said “we have a reservation.” I did everything by the book, these are just major assholes.\nMOREOVER, the problem with them still being there after I confronted them is that it added more stress to my service. I would’ve refused them had I known they didn’t have a reservation as I didn’t have room for another group of 8 people. I had to seat the actual reservation out of honour and respect of them making one, thus I now have 15 extra people instead of the original 7, on top of everyone else that was in the restaurant who were groups of 2s, 3s and 4s.

    "response": "Here's an analysis of the situation, followed by a tip calculation:\n\n### Video Analysis ###\n\n*   **Video Evaluation Criteria:**\n    *   **a) Reliability:** 3. Mostly accurate orders, occasional lack of confirmation. The server correctly identified the lack of a reservation and the table theft. The server was likely unable to meet all of the customer's needs.\n        *   *Justification:* The server handled the reservation issue correctly initially. However, the server was ultimately stressed and unable to handle the demands.\n    *   **b) Responsiveness:** 3. Average response speed, acceptable performance. The server was likely slowed down due to the situation, and had to take on the extra demand due to the table's dishonesty.\n        *   *Justification:* The server was already overwhelmed and likely couldn't be as responsive as they would have liked.\n    *   **c) Assurance:** 3. Can explain the menu but lacks confidence. The server may not have been confident due to being understaffed and dealing with a difficult table.\n        *   *Justification:* The server was likely feeling stressed and dealing with a difficult situation, which would be a negative impact.\n    *   **d) Empathy:** 2. Provides only minimal consideration. The server's ability to empathize would have been limited due to the stress and the customer's behavior.\n        *   *Justification:* The server was likely too stressed to provide much personalized service.\n    *   **e) Tangibles:** 4. Uniform and table settings are tidy, cleanliness maintained. *This is a general assumption as the video doesn't specify, but in the context of the narrative, there's nothing to suggest the restaurant was unkempt.*\n        *   *Justification:* Since there's no information to the contrary, I'm assuming a generally clean environment.\n*   **1-2. Video Score Calculation**\n    *   Video Score = (3 + 3 + 3 + 2 + 4) * 4 = 60\n### 5. Total Score\n    5-1. Total Score Calculation\n        Total Score = Video Score = 60\n### 6. Tip Calculation\n\n*   **a) Categorize the service level:**  The total score is 60. Based on the USA casual dining guidelines (Poor [0-5]%, Normal [6-15]%, Good [16-20]%), the service falls into the Normal range.\n*   **b) Determine the tipping percentage:** The server was in a difficult situation, and the customers were rude and disrespectful. While the server handled the situation professionally initially, the service was negatively affected by the customers' behavior and the understaffing. Therefore, the tip should be at the lower end of the normal range.\n    *   USA Casual Dining: Normal [6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15]%.\n    *   The customers were rude, so the tip should be towards the lower end.\n    *   The final tip percentage is 6%.\n\n*   **Bill Calculation:**\n    *   Subtotal: $25.00\n    *   Tip Amount: $25.00 \\* 0.06 = $1.50\n    *   Total Bill: $25.00 + $1.50 = $26.50\n\n### 7.

It's been over a decade since I've worked in any type of restaurant, however some outstanding events will never leave my memory.\n\nI'll post this one first and when I have the time, I'll post others. \n\nI used to be a server at a popular seafood restaurant in the Inland Empire. There was a large Black population in the city the restaurant was in, so a large portion of our guests would be Black people. This never bothered me because, well, why the heck should it? I took care of everyone all the same who crossed my path and I've never had any issues. \n\nWell, it wasn't until I was about a month into this restaurant and working the lunch shift that I started to fully pay attention to how my fellow servers treated customers. This particular day had a lot of Black guests. There were groans coming from my co-workers, all complaining that Black people are cheap, they don't tip, blah blah blah. So I asked one server if it's that much of an issue for you, I'll be happy to take your table. They happily said yes. Soon the majority of servers all gave up their tables to me simply because the people were Black and they thought it would be a waste of time. \n\nI was really pissed and disappointed in everyone, but I didn't have too much of a backbone nor an understanding of how to begin to have a talk about race with others, so I did the next best thing. Any time a table had left, I went to check my tip then I went to the server who gave up their table to me and told them how much I was tipped. Each time it was at least 20% tip, each time they seemed shocked and a little upset they gave up the table. By the end of my shift, I made about $200, though that would be the only time I would ever make that during lunch because other servers didn't give up as many tables to me anymore. \n\nAfter the lunch rush I had come to the conclusion that maybe Black people don't suck at tipping, maybe your crappy attitude towards them affects how you serve them and you just suck. Why should they tip you? \n\nIn Arizona, Mexican people were the targets of this stereotyping. Again, I've never had an issue with any person of any race. I was tipped based on how well I served them or from what they could afford. Everyone deserves to have a night out, but that doesn't mean that they can also afford to tip generously.",

Clean cut. Beautiful wife and kids. A little too well dressed for a Moroccan restaurant on a Sunday afternoon. It's a Jesus table. Nothing wrong with that. As long as I get a tip and not a Chick tract. I'm busting my ass this particular Sunday, I'm the lone server at this place known for its 5 course Moroccan meal of tagines and fig deserts with the occasional belly dancer. The kids love the belly dancers, and the dads usually do to. It's like a PG strip club of 5 year olds stuffing bills into the dress of an undulating ladies. And of course, about half of these girls dance downtown as well. The belly dancer is doing her routine, and I'm rotating 6 different tables through different parts of thr 5 course meal while dressed as an extra in Raiders of the Lost Ark when the Jesus table finishes dessert and tips 20 on card. I see the father of this holy family of 5 pull out a crisp 20 dollar bill and brandish it aloft while staring at me, not those bullshit ones with the prayers on them, genuine American fiat. I approach between running a Bassila and clearing a course to see what's up. He says, \"now young man, we have already paid and tipped for your wonderful service, but we would like to offer you this bill for a moment of your time \" I can hear Antonio calling for me, my eye twitches, but an extra 20 bucks ain't bad at this spot. \"We'd like to say a prayer with you.\" I went to catholic school but am not a big practicer. But damn if I didn't grab their hands and lead them through an Out Father faster than a battlefield chaplain. I snatched the twenty and thanked them, and for once, thanked my parents for sending me off to be taught by nuns.\n\n### Video Caption ###\nThe server was the sole server for the restaurant, managing 6 tables through a five-course meal simultaneously.

    "text_content": "I work at a resort restaurant that serves food to a neighboring poolside bar.  Every summer, when the bar opens, I'm scheduled to work as a cocktail server, taking and running orders to customers.  Yesterday was my first big day back as a server and I was excited.\n\nThis weekend, the resort was hosting a big golf tournament and a large wedding, so the pool was LOADED with people.  Imagine a sea of human heads bobbing up and down rather than water, and you can basically imagine what our crowd was like.  And these people were THIRSTY.  They wanted alcohol and, luckily for them, I was here to make their dreams come true.\n\nThe shift was absolute chaos.  People were demanding drinks every five minutes and it was difficult to keep up with, especially with the Texas heat boiling everything in sight.  Half way through, I come up to a group of gentlemen, who were part of the golf tournament (important for later).  I'm taking a few orders from them, when one of their friends, who I'll just call Jeff, cuts in and tells me that he's going to get his credit card and for me to charge all their drinks onto that card.  I say okay and as he's exiting the cool, sunscreen-tainted waters of the pool to get his card, I'm talking to his friends and finishing their orders.\n\nA minute later, I hear a loud, piercing whistle echo right above and behind me.  Then, I hear a bellowing \"HEY!\"\n\nOne by one, heads in the pool start to turn.  Their eyes show an expression or either confusion or curiosity as the source of the whistle, our deer friend Jeff, holds his credit card in the air.\n\nHe then says *\"EVERYONE GETS ONE ON ME!  ONE. DRINK!\"*\n\nThere's a millisecond of silence before the crowded pool erupts into cheers, victorious whistling, and chanting as Jeff stands there, victorious.  You know those scenes in movies where a guy says \"drinks are on me?\"  Well, to be honest, I never once thought I'd be in the middle of such a scenario.  I felt like I had stumbled into a crowded concert, not a pool.  My poor, introverted little heart was freaking out while my mind was trying to figure out what the heck was going on.  As I stand up, Jeff proudly hands me his card, which I take with a fearful and uncertain gaze I kept hidden behind my sunglasses.  I retreat to the bar, where my bewildered and unaware co-workers and customers stand questioning what happened.  I'm holding Jeff's card, asking what to do, and I'm told to basically do it.\n\nSo that's what I did.\n\nI went around the pool, taking orders as normal and keeping the card with me.  I stop by this one guy, Gary, who I recognized as one of the men in the group and ask him why Jeff did this and if it was TRULY okay.  I honestly thought maybe he was drunk and this was a decision made solely on that and was worried to charge a poor drunk man with hundreds of dollars of drinks.  Gary chuckles and said he was definitely serious and explains that it's a special occasion.\n\nRemember how I said these guys were from a golf tournament?  Well, Jeff had apparently participated and got a Hole-in-One on one of the courses.  If you've never played golf or even know anything about it, this is INSANELY lucky and rare.  The odds depend on the kind of hole you're playing on as well as many other conditions, but the average golfer basically has a 12,500/1 chance in getting one.  The stars would LITERALLy have to align for a golfer to get a Hole-In-One.  I was honestly kind of shocked to learn this and told Gary that I didn't even think it was possible outside of a mini-golf game.  He smiles, looks at me, and says \"Well, why do you think he's celebrating it?\"\n\nI understood immediately, smiled, and got to work.\n\nWhat was originally chaos became APOCALYPTIC.  I, as well as my other co-worker, were constantly flagged down for drinks, even while we were delivering others.  We had so many orders for Pina Coladas that we burned through almost four gallons of mix, as well as two bottles of rum (we added alcohol, rather than mix it in the machine).  One of our bosses actually sent out a server from the inside to help and the look on his face when he saw the crowd was honestly kind of hilarious.  We took almost an hour to take everyone's orders, make them, and deliver them.  People were actually pretty patient and found our rushing around to be entertaining.  One couple even tipped me a $100 bill in secret because I was going back and forth so often without complaining at all, which they found impressive.  They even left a 110% tip on their check as thanks for the service.  I made sure to give them the best hugs a stranger could give another stranger.\n\nIn the end, Jeff's bill was somewhere around $760, which included a 20% tip we added.  I half expected Jeff to be upset in some capacity, but he was actually an awesome guy.   He took his massive bill, looked at the total, and just said \"Huh, well I expected it to be bigger!\"  He laughed, signed, and thanked me for the service.  He even patted me on the back before he and his group left for the day.\n\nDespite how terrified I was at first, the whole experience was really fun, if I'm being honest.  It helped how many people were understanding about it and even patient with us.  We're still struggling with understaffing, despite being so far away from the pandemic, and yet, we're working our butts off to make sure service is nearly perfect for our guests.  It's hard, but when people are appreciative and reward us for our hard work, it really helps us.\n\nTo Jeff, congrats on that Hole-In-One.  You deserved it!  I hope you remember that moment for the rest of your life and never EVER forget it.  And to the rest of you, whether you work in service or not, remember to tip your servers and always keep in mind that a lot of us care about you, not just as customers, but people with needs too.

Are you alright with that?” \nHe said “psh that’s fine” \n\nHe paid for his 50 dollar bill, AND the 200+ dollar bill (plus automatic gratuity). In addition, be tipped both me and my coworker 20 bucks each on top of the gratuity. \n\nHe spent about 300 bucks that day.\n\nThe party of 12 was shocked and thanked them for their kindness. \n\nIt was a good night shift :)\n\n\nEdit: wow I didn’t know how expensive other places can be LMAO. The party of 12 was a family from what I remember, like 6 adults and 6 kids. I don’t remember the prices nor what they ordered. But I remembered the rich family only ordered 4 sushi plates. Which were 10-12 bucks around that time each. \n\nI do remember the party of 12 ordered both ramens and sushi. The ramens were 11-15 bucks at the time. And the sushi was about 8-14 bucks depending which one you got. I don’t remember if anyone got soft drinks or alcohol. But cocktails were $3.50 and beers were about 8ish bucks I believe.

This happened when we were only allowed to have outdoor seating, so we didn t have many huge tables available. We have only 1 table with 6 chairs, and about 4 5 tables with 4 chairs. We had a family of 12, and according to our policy, we had to sit them separately and they weren t allowed to move seats. 4 out of the 12 decided to seat at the 6 chair table cause it was a lot bigger we allow customers to seat wherever they like just as long as they are following policy . About 30 minutes in, a family of 5 the rich family comes in. We tell them that there will be at least a 20 minute wait due to the people having the only 6 chair table and we weren t allowed to bring tables together. The rich family was about to leave until the people who sat at the huge table called us over and said they can move at a smaller table. The rich family thanks them and we move their food to another table and sat down the rich family. They order their food and towards the end of their meal, they asked if they can pay for the table that gave up their seat for them. I said: Oh most certainly! However they are actually a party of 12, and their bill is probably over 200 dollars. Are you alright with that? He said psh that s fine He paid for his 50 dollar bill, AND the 200 dollar bill plus automatic gratuity . In addition, be tipped both me and my coworker 20 bucks each on top of the gratuity. He spent about 300 bucks that day. The party of 12 was shocked and thanked them for their kindness. It was a good night shift : Edit: wow I didn t know how expensive other places can be LMAO. The party of 12 was a family from what I remember, like 6 adults and 6 kids. I don t remember the prices nor what they ordered. But I remembered the rich family only ordered 4 sushi plates.

And the sushi was about 8 14 bucks depending which one you got. I don t remember if anyone got soft drinks or alcohol. But cocktails were 3.50 and beers were about 8ish bucks I believe.

When ordering alcohol, I carded the kids but not the parents. The mom pipes up with the whole \"Heyyy I don't look that old, why didn't you card meeeeeeeee?????????\" I respond with \"okay, let me see your ID, then\" As it turns out, mommy dearest left her wallet at home. I inform her that, unfortunately, once requested, I am legally not allowed to serve her alcohol unless she produces a valid ID. Obviously, she's fucking FURIOUS about this, so I send the manager over to confirm with her that I am not allowed to serve her. It almost goes without saying that I didn't receive a tip, but hopefully this idiot learned something today.\n\n### Video Caption ###\nThe server carded some, but not all, adults ordering alcohol. When questioned by an adult not carded, the server offered to check their ID.

The server’s actions demonstrated an understanding of the law and the restaurant's policy.\n*   **d) Empathy:** 3 - While the server correctly followed protocol and remained professional, they did not display exceptional empathy.

(The caption doesn't mention any order mistakes, but also doesn't highlight order accuracy procedures. Therefore, it's somewhere in the middle.)\n        *Reasoning: While the caption doesn't mention order mistakes, it also doesn't mention any specific confirmation procedures. Given the chaotic situation, the focus was on getting food out, not necessarily perfect order confirmation.*\n\n    *   b) Responsiveness: 3 - Average response speed, acceptable performance. (The server was likely busy and might not have been able to immediately address every need.)\n        *Reasoning: The caption doesn't give any information about responsiveness, but the situation likely made it difficult to be overly responsive.*\n\n    *   c) Assurance: 3 - Can explain the menu but lacks confidence. (Again, not enough information to score higher.)\n        *Reasoning: The caption does not say anything about the server's ability to explain the menu. The chaos of the situation likely wouldn't allow for high assurance, so this is somewhere in the middle.*\n\n    *   d) Empathy: 3 - Basic friendliness but lacks personalization. (Given the circumstances, the server likely focused on the basic needs.)\n        *Reasoning: The caption focuses on the functional aspects of service, but the chaotic lunch rush probably didn't allow for a high degree of personalization.*\n\n    *   e) Tangibles: 4 - Uniform and table settings are tidy, cleanliness maintained. (The server was presentable despite the rush.)\n        *Reasoning: The caption mentions the server maintained their appearance, indicating attention to tangibles.\n\n    1-2. **Video Score Calculation**\n        Video Score = (3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 4) \\* 4 = 64\n\n2.  **Reddit Post Analysis**\n    *   **Negative Aspects:**\n        *   The restaurant keeps a portion of the tips, which is unethical and illegal.\n        *   The owner made a highly unprofessional and offensive comment about the server's appearance. This is a major ethical issue and shows a lack of respect.\n        *   The restaurant is understaffed and poorly managed.\n    *   **Positive Aspects:**\n        *   The server is good at their job (according to their own assessment).\n        *   The server's regulars are good tippers.\n\n3.  **Google Reviews & User Reviews:**  (No specific Google or user reviews are provided.)\n\n4.  **Star Rating:** (No star rating provided)\n\n5.  **Total Score**\n    5-1. **Total Score Calculation**\n        Total Score = 64\n\n6.  **Tip Calculation**\n    6-1.

We ran out of a lot of items like steak, rice, and fries, which can usually be replaced with an alternative.

I ve been a waitress for my family s small Mexican restaurant for about 6 years out of 12 it s been open and I ve had my fair share of waitressing horror stories, but this one really stuck with me. My uncle owner works seven days a week to run and manage his restaurant literally from 5 in the morning until 9 pm sometimes and on Sunday s we close an hour earlier than weekdays because he likes to go home and relax or spend time with his family. So, one particular Sunday we had been slammed all day. We ran out of a lot of items like steak, rice, and fries, which can usually be replaced with an alternative. Either way we made it to the end of the day with no problem. Until... a family of ten shows up at the door. I was exhausted from the tough day and when I saw them I wanted to evaporate into thin air. But, they made a valid argument that we were technically still open and my uncle peeped his head out of the kitchen and told me to just let them in and he ll turn the stoves on again and see what he can make them. Also, let me be clear that I WARNED them before they sat down that we had run out of a lot of items and the husband and some of the older kids agreed they should just go somewhere else but the wife argued that they re already here, so they sat down. Also let me point out that she looked like she was already not in the best of moods, or had the best attitude to begin with. They looked at their menus and I brought them their drinks and everything was going fine until it was time to take their orders. It s like they completely forgot I warned them and they asked for the things we were missing anyway... and i had to deny them one by one all the items they were listing while the wife rolled her eyes at me each time. I offered them the alternatives and they would complain saying they preferred steak over chicken and stuff like that and she asked if they were getting a discount because we were out of stuff and usually I would ve said yes because I have a lot of control over stuff like that, since it s my family s place, but this lady was so rude and I was tired and not in the mood to be fake friendly. So I told her we don t offer discounts for things that can be replaced with alternatives. She did not like that. They eventually got their food and let me note that it s almost an hour after closing now and they still haven t left. Even after they ve finished eating they sat and talk for another 15 minutes. I am tired, annoyed, and I have school the next day. They come to the register after they re finally done chatting and my cousin at the register charges them for their food and then they start pestering her over a discount and how we should ve gone to the deli or a store to get them what they wanted because the customer is always right My uncle was nice enough to even let them in after we had already turned everything off to start cleaning. Also they left no tip and announced they ll never come back again and were gonna tell their friends to never come here again either. Also guess who came back only a few months later. That same family of ten.\n\n### Video Caption ###\nThe server warned a party of ten about item unavailability before seating them past closing time. She later informed them again about out-of-stock items when taking orders and offered alternatives. The server declined their request for a discount related to the unavailable items. She remained with the party until they departed, approximately an hour past closing.\n\n### User Input ###\n    1. Country: USA, Type: Casual dining\n    2. Restaurant name: Gold Spoon\n    3.

    "response": "Here's the analysis and tip calculation based on the provided information:\n\n### Analysis of Reddit Post and Video\n\nThe Reddit post describes a challenging situation where the waitress, working at her family's restaurant, dealt with a demanding customer who was unhappy about item unavailability. The video caption provides a concise summary of the waitress's actions.\n\n### 1-1. Video Evaluation Criteria and Scores\n\n*   **a) Reliability: 3**\n    *   **Justification:** The waitress made efforts to inform the customers about item shortages both before seating and during ordering. However, the situation led to customer dissatisfaction. There were no major order mistakes or billing errors, but the lack of available items caused issues.\n*   **b) Responsiveness: 4**\n    *   **Justification:** The waitress was responsive in taking the order and offering alternatives. The post does not highlight any delay in service.\n*   **c) Assurance: 3**\n    *   **Justification:** The waitress attempted to inform them about what was available, but her lack of willingness to provide a discount suggests a lack of confidence in handling the situation.\n*   **d) Empathy: 2**\n    *   **Justification:** The waitress was likely exhausted, which limited her ability to provide a personalized experience. The post highlights a lack of friendliness due to her frustration.\n*   **e) Tangibles: 4**\n    *   **Justification:** There's no information about the restaurant's cleanliness. However, since there are no comments about issues with the restaurant's cleanliness, a base score is provided.\n\n### 1-2. Video Score Calculation\n\nVideo Score = (3 + 4 + 3 + 2 + 4) \\* 4 = 64\n\n### 5. Total Score\n\n5-1. Total Score Calculation\n\nTotal Score = Video Score = 64\n\n### 6. Tip Calculation\n\n6-1. Calculate the tip based on the total score and analysis.\n\n*   Service Level: The total score indicates the service level is **Normal**.\n\n*   Tipping Percentage:\n    *   Country: USA\n    *   Restaurant Type: Casual Dining\n    *   Tipping Range: Normal \\[6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15\\]%\n\n*   User and Google Reviews: The post suggests the customer was rude and did not tip, but the waitress was professional in handling the complaints despite being exhausted. Based on the video, the waitress made an effort to communicate clearly with the customers and offer alternative options. The user reviews do not mention any negative feedback that should reduce the tip.\n\n*   Final Tip Percentage: The tip percentage should be at the higher end of the normal tipping range. Thus, 15% will be applied.\n\n6-2. Format\n\n```json\n{\n  \"### Video Caption 1 ###\": \"The server warned a party of ten about item unavailability before seating them past closing time.

    "text_content": "I work at a hotel bar. A group of three came in early-ish in the evening and I got a vibe that they weren’t the going to tip well right from the start. I’ve served folks that carried themselves in similar fashions who didn’t, but, I’m open to being surprised! \n\nOne of the guys is celebrating his birthday! They’re chatty and kind of fun so I think okay, I can snag a coupon from the front desk and let him have a mixed drink on the house for his special night. His girlfriend orders a holy water and we joke about being basic bitches, we’re having a good time so far! \n\nThey order a few shots and more mixed drinks and beer, eventually the bill is just shy of $110. The third fella, who seems to be third-wheeling it for his buddy’s birthday, asks what the bill is and brings out his wallet. Puts $120 in cash down, I grab him his change, and his pals get up and leave. One fella at the bar asks, “Did they leave you anything?” \nI still have a smile on my face. “No, and I could’ve made a lot of money had I bet on it too.”\n\nHalf a hour later they come back down for a smoke and birthday boy orders some drinks for the room. We get talking while I’m whipping them up and turns out he’s from my neck of the woods on the other side of the country! We reminisce about the mountains and the mild winters, smiles all around. He pays for his bill in cash, takes the change I got him and puts it in his pocket and once again walks away. I’m still smiling. The guy at the bar is shocked that I am not fuming. Eh, the hourly pays my rent, but the night is not off the a very great start, mentally I have already thrown in the towel. \n\nSome time goes by and a bunch of friends come by the bar. Whiskey and ginger ale are flowing, 3 rounds of tequila, caesars and beer galore. I’m happy to be busy, I wasn’t expecting it on a Saturday (they’re quite hit or miss), but I’m getting into the groove and doing my best to chat and entertain while making drink after shot after drink. They all pay up and tip accordingly, some $1/drink, others just hit 15% on the machine, but I don’t think the night can really be salvaged despite the slight change in mood. \n\nMost file out apart from two from the busy group, they’re enjoying my caesars and my company. We talk about life and vacations and music and even politics, they invite me to their nearby cabin this summer and insist they buy me a shot tonight. It’s getting late and I’m tired but these folks truly are splendid, they settle up and add an extra 20% to the total, she leaves and few coins in exchange for limes for the tequila they have in their room, and then the husband asks for one more drink to bring upstairs. \n\nOne more ounce of whiskey and I give him a can of ginger ale for the road. Credit machine in hand, he types in the gratuity, shows the wife and she nods with a quick thumbs up, and presses “OK”. A receipt with a $50 tip, for one drink, prints in front of my eyes almost as if it were in slow motion. The tears are welling, and I barely manage a thank you before he says “this is one of the best experiences I’ve had at a bar, and you’re the bartender that made that possible.” \n\nReader, some days might seem like dead ends or write offs, but if you have the energy to keep smiling and think happy thoughts, maybe just a little bit of good karma will find its way to you.",

A group of three came in early ish in the evening and I got a vibe that they weren t the going to tip well right from the start. I ve served folks that carried themselves in similar fashions who didn t, but, I m open to being surprised! One of the guys is celebrating his birthday! They re chatty and kind of fun so I think okay, I can snag a coupon from the front desk and let him have a mixed drink on the house for his special night. His girlfriend orders a holy water and we joke about being basic bitches, we re having a good time so far! They order a few shots and more mixed drinks and beer, eventually the bill is just shy of 110. The third fella, who seems to be third wheeling it for his buddy s birthday, asks what the bill is and brings out his wallet. Puts 120 in cash down, I grab him his change, and his pals get up and leave. One fella at the bar asks, Did they leave you anything? I still have a smile on my face. No, and I could ve made a lot of money had I bet on it too. Half a hour later they come back down for a smoke and birthday boy orders some drinks for the room. We get talking while I m whipping them up and turns out he s from my neck of the woods on the other side of the country! We reminisce about the mountains and the mild winters, smiles all around. He pays for his bill in cash, takes the change I got him and puts it in his pocket and once again walks away. I m still smiling. The guy at the bar is shocked that I am not fuming. Eh, the hourly pays my rent, but the night is not off the a very great start, mentally I have already thrown in the towel. Some time goes by and a bunch of friends come by the bar. Whiskey and ginger ale are flowing, 3 rounds of tequila, caesars and beer galore. I m happy to be busy, I wasn t expecting it on a Saturday they re quite hit or miss , but I m getting into the groove and doing my best to chat and entertain while making drink after shot after drink. They all pay up and tip accordingly, some 1 drink, others just hit 15 on the machine, but I don t think the night can really be salvaged despite the slight change in mood. Most file out apart from two from the busy group, they re enjoying my caesars and my company. We talk about life and vacations and music and even politics, they invite me to their nearby cabin this summer and insist they buy me a shot tonight. It s getting late and I m tired but these folks truly are splendid, they settle up and add an extra 20 to the total, she leaves and few coins in exchange for limes for the tequila they have in their room, and then the husband asks for one more drink to bring upstairs. One more ounce of whiskey and I give him a can of ginger ale for the road. Credit machine in hand, he types in the gratuity, shows the wife and she nods with a quick thumbs up, and presses OK . A receipt with a 50 tip, for one drink, prints in front of my eyes almost as if it were in slow motion. The tears are welling, and I barely manage a thank you before he says this is one of the best experiences I ve had at a bar, and you re the bartender that made that possible. Reader, some days might seem like dead ends or write offs, but if you have the energy to keep smiling and think happy thoughts, maybe just a little bit of good karma will find its way to you.\n\n### Video Caption ###\nThe server proactively offered a free drink and engaged in friendly conversation with customers, maintaining a positive attitude throughout the shift, even when not initially tipped.

The prompt handling of complaints suggests a competent understanding of service, showing confidence in their ability to provide great service.\n    *   *Reason:* The server clearly explained the automatic gratuity policy.\n*   **d) Empathy:** 3 - The server's actions, like offering to remove a portion of the bill, show some level of understanding and willingness to fix customer’s issue, but it doesn't show that the server went above and beyond to enhance their dining experience.\n    *   *Reason:* The server offered to remove a small amount from the bill, showing that they understood the customer’s concern and tried to help them.\n*   **e) Tangibles:** 4 - The video does not focus on tangibles. However, considering the setting is a diner, it is assumed that the diner is generally tidy, and the server's uniform is clean.\n    *   *Reason:* The video doesn't provide specific information about the tangible aspects. However, it is assumed that the server’s uniform and the restaurant were clean.\n\n**1-2. Video Score Calculation**\n\nVideo Score = (4 + 4 + 4 + 3 + 4) \\* 4 = 76\n\n**5. Total Score**\n\n**5-1. Total Score Calculation**\n\nTotal Score = 76\n\n**6. Tip Calculation**\n\n**6-1. Calculate the tip based on the total score and analysis.**\n\n*   Service Level: The total video score of 76 puts the service in the \"Good\" category.\n*   Tipping Percentage: Since the restaurant is in the USA, casual dining, the tip range is 16-20%.\n*   Review Analysis: The customer in the video was happy about the server’s service. Therefore, it can be assumed that the service was great.\n\nConsidering the above factors, I will choose a tip percentage at the high end of the range.\n\n**6-2.

The restaurant I work at has two floors. Upstairs isn’t always open on the slow nights but we usually still have three servers downstairs. Tonight we only had 2, myself and another waitress. It’s not anything overwhelming but you’re definitely BUSY with only two girls on. In my section I have a few booths that seat 4 people and then a bigger booth that seats 7-8. My big booth was taken by a five top who was finishing up when I had a lady at the smaller booth tell me that her two top is changing to 7 top. Restaurant is completely full at the time but I tell her no problem, as soon as the big booth leaves it’s all hers. Five minutes goes by and she flags me down, “do you know when they’re leaving?!” “No mam, I’m sorry I don’t. It should be soon though, they’re cashed out.” I walk away to take care of my other customers only to get flagged down again, “we really need that booth!” (Keep in mind it’s still only her and what I assumed was her daughter, rest of the party not there yet) “I understand, it shouldn’t be too much longer.” Another couple minutes go by and then she waves and snaps at me!! “CAN’T YOU GO KICK THEM OUT?!” “No mam I’m sorry I can’t do that, they’re paying customers but I can go ask how much longer they will be.” So I walk my irritated ass over to this big booth and pop a squat next to these strangers and say “I’m not sure how unprofessional this is, but I have this really rude lady begging for your booth so can you guys please stay longer?” One of the gentleman laughed and said “oh I’m sorry we were just about to leave.” And before I could say anything the wife goes “no honey I think she’s serious.” Damn straight I was serious. I said “I will buy you guys dessert to sit here for a little bit longer.” They declined the dessert but were more than happy to stay put for awhile. I thought the rude lady was going to snap her neck with the amount of times she turned around to see if they were still there. And of course once rude lady and her party finally got the table they were ALL rude and demanding as hell. I’m talking finger snapping, waving, and trying to talk to me while I’m at another table. Needless to say, they had the gratuity slapped on their bill the second I rang their food in.",

    "text_content": "I’ve only been serving for a few months. I wouldn’t say I’m fantastic at my job - I still get weeded sometimes, have sent back a few wrong orders, sometimes trip over my words. But I think I do a pretty decent job and I try my hardest to be genuinely nice to every one and make sure they have a good experience when they dine in. \n\nOn average I get tipped like 16-20% a night. I think it’s on the lower end because we’re in the south and also a college town and people don’t know how to tip. It’s about on par with what all my coworkers make per shift. I’ve gotten stiffed a few times. \n\nAnyway recently I’ve started getting really big tips like once a week or so. I’m talking like $100 on $80, $30 on $75, $50 on $100. Is this normal? The tables that have left me these big tips I haven’t really gone out of my way for, I treat them like every other table. I’m not very outgoing like some of my coworkers so my service is pretty standard, it’s not like I’m chatting and connecting with these people. I make sure their food is hot, drinks refilled, and try to get them in and out as soon as they’re ready and that’s about it. The first time it happened I had to make sure the woman who tipped me meant to leave that much. Is this common? Do they just think I did that good of a job? Am I special or do they just tip like that every time they go out? Like I said I haven’t worked in this industry for long - before I did I just assumed everyone left 18-20% unless something went very wrong (I have learned that this is not the case at all).",

I wouldn t say I m fantastic at my job I still get weeded sometimes, have sent back a few wrong orders, sometimes trip over my words. But I think I do a pretty decent job and I try my hardest to be genuinely nice to every one and make sure they have a good experience when they dine in. On average I get tipped like 16 20 a night. I think it s on the lower end because we re in the south and also a college town and people don t know how to tip. It s about on par with what all my coworkers make per shift. I ve gotten stiffed a few times. Anyway recently I ve started getting really big tips like once a week or so. I m talking like 100 on 80, 30 on 75, 50 on 100. Is this normal? The tables that have left me these big tips I haven t really gone out of my way for, I treat them like every other table. I m not very outgoing like some of my coworkers so my service is pretty standard, it s not like I m chatting and connecting with these people. I make sure their food is hot, drinks refilled, and try to get them in and out as soon as they re ready and that s about it. The first time it happened I had to make sure the woman who tipped me meant to leave that much. Is this common? Do they just think I did that good of a job? Am I special or do they just tip like that every time they go out? Like I said I haven t worked in this industry for long before I did I just assumed everyone left 18 20 unless something went very wrong I have learned that this is not the case at all .\n\n### Video Caption ###\nThe server acknowledges sometimes getting overwhelmed, sending back wrong orders, and occasionally tripping over words.

However, the server focuses on delivering the orders.\n    b) Responsiveness: 3 - The server focuses on ensuring hot food, refilled drinks, and efficient table turnover which can be interpreted as average response speed.\n    c) Assurance: 3 - The server states they are trying their hardest to be genuinely nice to every one and make sure they have a good experience when they dine in. This can be seen as being able to explain and provide confidence and trust, but may not be confident in handling a premium suggestion like wine pairings.\n    d) Empathy: 3 - The server focuses on being genuinely nice to every one and make sure they have a good experience when they dine in, this can be seen as basic friendliness but lacks personalization.\n    e) Tangibles: 4 - Although the video does not directly assess tangibles such as cleanliness.

    "text_content": "*Obligatory mobile apology*\n\nStill buzzing from my last table last night, so I need to vent.\n\nI work at a semi fine dining restaurant in a major city (US), and people go there a lot for special occasions. The holiday rush has been crazy, lots of birthdays and holiday parties and graduations, etc.\n\nMy last party of nine comes in dressed to the nines for a girl’s birthday. They ask for specific drink choices and prices, and I get them all promptly. Straws and lemons for their water, hot water so they can sanitize their cutlery, you name it. Also give them plenty of space because they’re taking lots of pictures (a few group photos which I take), again no problems. Both my manager and I ask multiple times if everything’s great (including their crazy modified food items) and they tell me it is.\n\nHere’s where things get bumpy. \n\nThey ask for split checks (against company policy but if I’m not busy I do it because it’s not that big of a deal) and they scooched around a lot so my seat numbers weren’t perfect. It took a few extra minutes to get everything separate, and I could tell they were getting frustrated. They keep pointing to the auto-gratuity and we’re talking to themselves about it. Finally, someone pulled me aside and asked to take off the gratuity (automatic 18% for parties of six or more which is stated on our website and menu that they all had). I tried my best to keep a smile on my face since someone basically said to my face that I don’t deserve to make a living, and grabbed my manager. She gave the spiel of auto gratuity, and that we won’t be taking it off. Some things I heard as my manager and I were running their payments:\n\n“If the tip is added this way then service should be on point”\n\n“Well I read the whole menu and saw nothing about that”\n\n“Well I didn’t like this I shouldn’t have to pay for tip on top of it”\n\n“Run this card, but don’t put a penny more on it”\n\nThey all asked for their food to be boxed up, so I had no knowledge things weren’t up to their standards. At this point my manager and I are just trying to get them out of here, so we take a couple things off the bill. It all worked out at the end and I’ve dealt with worse I just can’t get over what I could have done more to give them 18% worth of great service. In the end I know the service was good they just didn’t want to pay for it. Just having someone look you in the eye and say you don’t deserve your tip is rattling. I’m dreading going back in tonight. \n\nThanks for letting me vent, and we only have a couple weeks left of holiday craziness! Keep your chins up, everyone!",

They ask for specific drink choices and prices, and I get them all promptly. Straws and lemons for their water, hot water so they can sanitize their cutlery, you name it. Also give them plenty of space because they re taking lots of pictures a few group photos which I take , again no problems. Both my manager and I ask multiple times if everything s great including their crazy modified food items and they tell me it is. Here s where things get bumpy. They ask for split checks against company policy but if I m not busy I do it because it s not that big of a deal and they scooched around a lot so my seat numbers weren t perfect. It took a few extra minutes to get everything separate, and I could tell they were getting frustrated. They keep pointing to the auto gratuity and we re talking to themselves about it. Finally, someone pulled me aside and asked to take off the gratuity automatic 18 for parties of six or more which is stated on our website and menu that they all had . I tried my best to keep a smile on my face since someone basically said to my face that I don t deserve to make a living, and grabbed my manager. She gave the spiel of auto gratuity, and that we won t be taking it off. Some things I heard as my manager and I were running their payments: If the tip is added this way then service should be on point Well I read the whole menu and saw nothing about that Well I didn t like this I shouldn t have to pay for tip on top of it Run this card, but don t put a penny more on it They all asked for their food to be boxed up, so I had no knowledge things weren t up to their standards. At this point my manager and I are just trying to get them out of here, so we take a couple things off the bill. It all worked out at the end and I ve dealt with worse I just can t get over what I could have done more to give them 18 worth of great service. In the end I know the service was good they just didn t want to pay for it. Just having someone look you in the eye and say you don t deserve your tip is rattling. I m dreading going back in tonight. Thanks for letting me vent, and we only have a couple weeks left of holiday craziness! Keep your chins up, everyone!\n\n### Video Caption ###\nThe server promptly provided specific drink details, prices, and requested water accompaniments. They checked multiple times regarding food satisfaction and received positive confirmations initially. The server attempted to accommodate an off-policy request to split checks, which resulted in a delay, and participated in adjusting the bill as a service recovery action. They maintained composure during a dispute over the automatic [REMOVED] policy.\n\n### User Input ###\n    1. Country: USA, Type: Casual dining\n    2. Restaurant name: Gold Spoon\n    3.

    "response": "Okay, I will analyze the provided information, evaluate the video, and calculate the appropriate tip.\n\n### Analysis of the Reddit Post and Video Caption ###\n\nThe Reddit post describes a situation where the server provided attentive service, including specific drink requests, accommodating modifications, and taking photos. Despite positive feedback during the meal, the guests became upset about the automatic gratuity and ultimately disputed the bill. The video caption supports the Reddit post.\n\n1-1. Video Evaluation Criteria\n\n*   a) Reliability: **4**. The server correctly handled custom orders and specific drink requests. They accommodated the requests of the group with modified food items. The attempt to split the checks, although ultimately causing some delay, shows a willingness to accommodate the customer's needs. However, the delay caused by the splitting of checks and the customers' dissatisfaction could mean that perfect reliability isn't present.\n*   b) Responsiveness: **5**. The server promptly fulfilled drink orders and provided water accompaniments. The post mentions the server proactively checked on the party multiple times and took group photos upon request. They remained composed and professional during a difficult situation.\n*   c) Assurance: **4**. The server correctly provided the menu and drink prices, as well as handled the customers' special requests. They were able to handle the issues with the checks, though it wasn't perfect. The server remained professional and composed, even when faced with criticism.\n*   d) Empathy: **3**. While the server remained professional and accommodating throughout the meal and handled their requests appropriately, the post does not mention them going above and beyond in the area of personalization or emotional understanding. They did not appear to get to know the guests personally.\n*   e) Tangibles: **5**. No information is provided regarding the appearance of the server or the cleanliness of the table/utensils, but none of it was brought up by the customer. I must assume the basics were satisfactory since no information was present.\n\n1-2. Video Score Calculation\n\nVideo Score = (4 + 5 + 4 + 3 + 5) * 4 = 84\n\n5.  Total Score\n\n5-1. Total Score Calculation\nTotal Score = Video Score = 84\n\n6.  Tip Calculation\n\n    6-1. Calculate the tip based on the total score and analysis.\n\n    *   Categorize the service level as Poor, Normal, or Good based on the total score.\n        *   Since the video score is 84, this is a \"Good\" level of service.\n    *   Determine the tipping percentage within the culturally appropriate range according to the selected country and restaurant type.\n        *   Country: USA\n        *   Type: Casual Dining\n        *   Tipping Range for Good Service: 16-20%\n    *   Based on the Reddit post: The server provided good service but faced an issue regarding the gratuity. The users ultimately complained and got the bill adjusted. The guests didn't necessarily think the service was worth the automatic gratuity, so I should choose the lower end of the Good range.\n\n    6-2.

    "text_content": "So it's Saturday night, dinner rush, and for some unknown reason I'm in the party section of my restaurant. I hate the party section. Endless 10/15 tops the whole shift, and I find I generally make more money on smaller, more easily turned tables. But whatever, I'm a team player so I attack the shift with gusto.  \n\nOne of my parties was a 14 top family dinner. At the start of their meal the patriarch of the family, an elderly man of about 75(ish), told me \"Listen here now, no matter what they say this is all on one check and I'm paying it!\"  Ok cool, one check, no splitting, makes my job easier. They order, things are going smoothly. As I'm serving, doing refills, etc, I notice a lady at the table surreptitiously palm some folding money to old dude's wife, a very sweet and tiny elderly lady. A few minutes later on a different pass through I see it again, from another guest at the table. And then again. \n\nAt the end of the meal I present the check to the grandfather of the group. Total of about $220. He pays with a card, I bring it back and say my goodbyes, and his wife motions me to her side, grabs my hands and says \"Thank you so much sweetie!\" and palms me some cash so quick and easy you'd have sworn she was a magician. I tuck it quickly away, tell her \"You're Welcome\", and go on my merry way. \n\nTurned out she slipped me $50. And when I picked up the CC slip that her husband left behind he had left me a solid $5 on his $220 bill. Clearly this was not his family's first rodeo with him paying the bill. \n\nAnyways, kudos to that family for understanding how to tip, and how to do it without pissing Grandpa off. And a special shout-out to his wife who was cute as a button and might have been a Three-Card Monty dealer in her younger days. Made my night.",

    "text_content": "This tale comes from my server/bartending days not the pharmacy. As you can tell from some of my other stories, I don't take shit. It's probably due to the fact that at this point I was a veteran and just didn't have time for your stupid customer BS. After you've been through some of the shit I've been through, the customer not having the correct amount of ice cubes in their beverage just doesn't seem to matter much to me. Just don't be doucher and we'll be cool. \n\nNow on to the tale: \n\nI knew the table was going to be about as fun as a bag of razor blades when I walked up to greet them and instead of returning my greeting they just barked out their drink orders. Nothing says \"hello, nice to meet you\" quite as eloquently as \"I'll have a diet, she'll have a diet, and he wants an iced tea\". But what can you do? They're not sociable people, fine, I still have a job to do. I went and fetched their springs. Apparently I've been relegated to wench tonight. \n\nWhen I returned with drinks there was 10 dollars in singles sitting on the end of the table. The clown who was obviously in charge of this bubbly and outgoing crew had placed them there. He said to me gruffly, \"This is your tip tonight. You'll start off with 10, every time I think you screw up or do something I don't like I'm removing a dollar or two\" \n\nIn my head I said, \"I\"m not a stripper, I'm not dancing for your dollar\"\n\nWhat I really said, as I scooped up the singles and placed them back in his hand was, \"Sir, you want to hold on to this, the bussers might get confused and think it was left from the table before you. I will give you the same service I give all of my tables; excellent. At the end of your meal when the bill comes you can then decide what amount of tip you'd like to leave.\" And before he could respond I added \"Would you guys like to start with an appetizer?\" \n\nI could see in his face that he was going to object, but before he got a chance his wife, reading the situation correctly (that I wasn't going to put up with her husband's shit) gave me their app order and I was off to my next table. I watched him grumble at her while he put his money back in his wallet. They were tolerable for the rest of their meal not outgoing or friendly by any means, but they didn't request anything out of the ordinary or ridiculous. \n\nAt the end of the meal I ended up with a 9 dollar tip. Not sure what random wronging I could have done to lose that dollar, maybe it was throwing his bullshit back in his face, but I wasn't even mad, that was still 20%. \n\n**TL;DR customer wants a handy with a reach around, I give him a punch in the solar plexus instead**. \n\nEdit: spelling",

As you can tell from some of my other stories, I don't take shit. It's probably due to the fact that at this point I was a veteran and just didn't have time for your stupid customer BS. After you've been through some of the shit I've been through, the customer not having the correct amount of ice cubes in their beverage just doesn't seem to matter much to me. Just don't be doucher and we'll be cool. Now on to the tale: I knew the table was going to be about as fun as a bag of razor blades when I walked up to greet them and instead of returning my greeting they just barked out their drink orders. Nothing says \"hello, nice to meet you\" quite as eloquently as \"I'll have a diet, she'll have a diet, and he wants an iced tea\". But what can you do? They're not sociable people, fine, I still have a job to do. I went and fetched their springs. Apparently I've been relegated to wench tonight. When I returned with drinks there was 10 dollars in singles sitting on the end of the table. The clown who was obviously in charge of this bubbly and outgoing crew had placed them there. He said to me gruffly, \"This is your tip tonight. You'll start off with 10, every time I think you screw up or do something I don't like I'm removing a dollar or two\" In my head I said, \"I\"m not a stripper, I'm not dancing for your dollar\" What I really said, as I scooped up the singles and placed them back in his hand was, \"Sir, you want to hold on to this, the bussers might get confused and think it was left from the table before you. I will give you the same service I give all of my tables; excellent. At the end of your meal when the bill comes you can then decide what amount of tip you'd like to leave.\" And before he could respond I added \"Would you guys like to start with an appetizer?\" I could see in his face that he was going to object, but before he got a chance his wife, reading the situation correctly that I wasn't going to put up with her husband's shit gave me their app order and I was off to my next table. I watched him grumble at her while he put his money back in his wallet. They were tolerable for the rest of their meal not outgoing or friendly by any means, but they didn't request anything out of the ordinary or ridiculous. At the end of the meal I ended up with a 9 dollar tip. Not sure what random wronging I could have done to lose that dollar, maybe it was throwing his bullshit back in his face, but I wasn't even mad, that was still 20 . TL;DR customer wants a handy with a reach around, I give him a punch in the solar plexus instead . Edit: spelling\n\n### Video Caption ###\nThe server initiated the interaction with a greeting and promptly delivered the initial drinks.

The guy picking up the tab, Billy, was a major wine-o and  complimented my suggestions for Chardonnay. He joked that I should buy a bottle for myself on his tab. I laughed it off but he brought it up again while I was serving after dinner drinks, he insisted I get a nice bottle for myself to take home. To take home!!! My boss said hell yes grab a good one.

I walked in the kitchen and handed out a $20 to everyone I worked with saying and you get $20 and you get $20. I still had more than enough left for myself. BOH was confused and tried to refuse it but I insisted. They deserve a tip too! \n\nI hope to one day be comfortable enough financially to even do half what Billy did for my co-workers and me.

I walked in the kitchen and handed out a 20 to everyone I worked with saying and you get 20 and you get 20. I still had more than enough left for myself. BOH was confused and tried to refuse it but I insisted. They deserve a tip too! I hope to one day be comfortable enough financially to even do half what Billy did for my co workers and me. Cheers! Edit: thanks for the gold stranger xoxo!\n\n### Video Caption ###\nThe server provided wine suggestions that were complimented by a customer.

Specific details regarding attentiveness timing, order accuracy, cleanliness, or service recovery efforts are not provided in the text.\n\n### User Input ###\n    1. Country: USA, Type: Casual dining\n    2. Restaurant name: Gold Spoon\n    3. Calculated subtotal: $25.00\n",
    "response": "Here's an analysis of the situation, considering the provided text and your instructions.\n\n### Analysis of the Reddit Post and Video Caption\n\n1-1. Video Evaluation Criteria\n\n*   **a) Reliability:** 4. While the caption doesn't explicitly state order accuracy, the server successfully handled the entire service for a high-value table and followed through with the customer's requests (wine suggestions, after-dinner drinks, etc.) and confirmed with management. This suggests a high degree of reliability, with no mentioned errors.\n    *   *Reason:* The text describes a smooth service experience without mention of order errors or mistakes. The server's handling of various requests indicates a high level of reliability.\n*   **b) Responsiveness:** 5. The server was very responsive to the customer's requests and was able to offer wine suggestions for the customer's request, indicating quick and polite responses, and possibly proactive service.\n    *   *Reason:* The text mentions the server was attentive to the customer's requests and proactively offered wine suggestions and processed orders efficiently.\n*   **c) Assurance:** 5. The server confidently handled the wine suggestions and recommendations and, when receiving the bottle, conferred with management, showing professional assurance.\n    *   *Reason:* The server demonstrated a high degree of knowledge (wine suggestions) and professional conduct (seeking manager approval for the gift).\n*   **d) Empathy:** 5. The server provided a top-tier experience, earning the customer's trust and resulting in a substantial tip and a gift from the customer.\n    *   *Reason:* The customer was impressed and felt compelled to tip the server generously.\n*   **e) Tangibles:** 5. This criterion cannot be directly evaluated from the text. However, given the context of an upscale restaurant, it is reasonable to assume a high standard of presentation and cleanliness, the server's uniform and table setting were well-maintained.\n    *   *Reason:* The setting is upscale.\n\n1-2. Video Score Calculation\n\n*   Video Score = (4 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 5) \\* 4 = 96\n\n5.  Total Score\n    5-1. Total Score Calculation\n\n    *   Total Score = Video Score = 96\n\n6.  Tip Calculation\n    6-1. Calculate the tip based on the total score and analysis.\n\n    *   Categorize the service level: The total score of 96 indicates excellent service (Good).\n    *   Restaurant Type: Casual Dining in the USA.\n    *   Tipping Range: Good is \\[16, 17, 18, 19, 20]% for Casual dining in the USA.\n    *   Reviews: The reviews are overwhelmingly positive, with a high level of customer satisfaction, and generous tipping.\n    *   Ethical Considerations: No ethical issues.\n    *   Final Tip Percentage: Choosing the upper end of the tipping range due to excellent service.\n    *   Subtotal: $25.00\n    *   Final tip amount = $25.00 \\* 20% = $5.00\n    *   Final total bill = $25.00 + $5.00 = $30.00\n\n7.

Just finished high-school, and decided to spend some time before uni to get some extra cash. \n\n**What happened:** I've been on shift for about 9 hours and the dinner rush was just starting, with all my combined duties, I was exhausted and customers were being..customers. (Snapping their fingers at me to call me over, changing orders last minute, not giving me two shits, letting their kids run around like the tiny fucktrophies they are etc.) Whatever, perks of the job. \n\nIn comes in a middle-aged caucasian man who seemed quiet and pleasant enough. I sit him down, and he's never been in our restaurant before, so I recommend dishes, take his order and make small talk. Throughout his entire dinner, he gave me absolutely no trouble and every time I had a moment to spare, I made sure that he had everything he needed, and we actually started talking about his work, why he was in Malaysia, turns out he was from France. So we practiced our french together, and we both had a grand ole time. \n\nThe bill came, and unfortunately, I was busy with another table so I couldn't say goodbye to him personally, but I did give him a wave and a smile as he went out.

Heck, we'd be lucky to even get a dollar on a good day. \n\nNeedless to say, I hoped he would come back again one day. And he did. An hour later. I was hostessing at that point and he came up to the little podium (the one with the menus &amp; reservation book) with a bag in hand.

I wasn't bothered. \n\nTwenty minutes after I see the cheap tipper's wife on her way back into the restaurant, all geared up for a fight. It was getting quiet at that point, just a couple tables. A great audience for what was about to occur. \n\nShe storms in, pulls out the bill and indignantly points out one of the appetizers, says that it was shared and as such her husband should NOT have been charged. \n\nShe says \"It is ridiculous that we should pay for this!\"\n\nI was chilled. I immediately felt a huge wave of pity for the husband who had clearly been drilled in the parking lot for fifteen minutes. \n\nI compose myself carefully, go ALL SMILES and ask, \"So you want me to reopen the table, refund the card, then charge the card again for a different amount and process the table again and have us eat the cost of the app?\" \n\nHer: \"Yes\"\n\nMe: \"Well, honestly... that's ridiculous. It's a lot of work. But I think I can make this right\"\n\nAnd I pulled out my wallet. I tried to hand it to her. \n\nMe: \"Seems to me like we owe you some money. So how much do you want?\" \n\nHer: \"What are you doing? Can't the restaurant cover it?\"\n\nMe: \"Sure, but I'm not gonna ask my boss to cover this one. The food was good, right? (She nods) and until I messed up with the bill, service was good? (nods again) ok so it's my mistake, this is between me and you, so let me make it right. How much do you want? Twenty dollars? Forty dollars?\"\n\nShe starts looking really uncomfortable at mugging me all of a sudden. I fan out my float, it's not a lot. I was 23 and looked it too. \n\n\"Go ahead! What was the app, 13 dollars plus tax and tip? Here take twenty for now and you've actually made a few dollars tonight, right? Is that enough? Do you want more? You can have my whole wallet.\" And I politely try to give her more. \n\nShellshocked as fuck, she slowly takes the twenty out of my hand and walks out of the restaurant. Head hanging way down. \n\nSometimes it's very clear what people want and sometimes giving to them makes them see what is really happening- a grown woman is leveraging her bad attitude and emotions to \"win one over\" on some kid, some business, anything at all. \n\nI would've paid 500$ easily to never see her again, I got a good deal. I still am awestruck she had the gall to take it. Third worst customer of my life. \n\nGood luck to all my fellow servers in here. It's a wild world. \n\nPs I was working at a small restaurant where my antics were well documented and occasionally appreciated, I wouldn't recommend this method somewhere corporate.",

I wasn't bothered. Twenty minutes after I see the cheap tipper's wife on her way back into the restaurant, all geared up for a fight. It was getting quiet at that point, just a couple tables. A great audience for what was about to occur. She storms in, pulls out the bill and indignantly points out one of the appetizers, says that it was shared and as such her husband should NOT have been charged. She says \"It is ridiculous that we should pay for this!\" I was chilled. I immediately felt a huge wave of pity for the husband who had clearly been drilled in the parking lot for fifteen minutes. I compose myself carefully, go ALL SMILES and ask, \"So you want me to reopen the table, refund the card, then charge the card again for a different amount and process the table again and have us eat the cost of the app?\" Her: \"Yes\" Me: \"Well, honestly... that's ridiculous. It's a lot of work. But I think I can make this right\" And I pulled out my wallet. I tried to hand it to her. Me: \"Seems to me like we owe you some money. So how much do you want?\" Her: \"What are you doing? Can't the restaurant cover it?\" Me: \"Sure, but I'm not gonna ask my boss to cover this one. The food was good, right? She nods and until I messed up with the bill, service was good? nods again ok so it's my mistake, this is between me and you, so let me make it right. How much do you want? Twenty dollars? Forty dollars?\" She starts looking really uncomfortable at mugging me all of a sudden. I fan out my float, it's not a lot. I was 23 and looked it too. \"Go ahead! What was the app, 13 dollars plus tax and tip? Here take twenty for now and you've actually made a few dollars tonight, right? Is that enough? Do you want more? You can have my whole wallet.\" And I politely try to give her more. Shellshocked as fuck, she slowly takes the twenty out of my hand and walks out of the restaurant. Head hanging way down. Sometimes it's very clear what people want and sometimes giving to them makes them see what is really happening a grown woman is leveraging her bad attitude and emotions to \"win one over\" on some kid, some business, anything at all. I would've paid 500 easily to never see her again, I got a good deal. I still am awestruck she had the gall to take it. Third worst customer of my life. Good luck to all my fellow servers in here. It's a wild world. Ps I was working at a small restaurant where my antics were well documented and occasionally appreciated, I wouldn't recommend this method somewhere corporate.\n\n### Video Caption ###\nThe server managed splitting a large bill for an eight-top and informed guests about discrepancies before billing.

The server made a billing error. While this error was addressed, it still indicates a lack of perfect reliability.\n        *   *Reasoning:* The server made a mistake in the bill. This is a direct indication of a lack of perfect accuracy. While the issue was resolved, the initial error is the key point.\n    *   **b) Responsiveness:** 5 - Immediate response, friendly tone and facial expressions, proactive problem-solving. The server addressed the customer's complaint immediately and proactively offered a solution.\n        *   *Reasoning:* The server was immediately responsive to the customer's issue. He was friendly and attempted to resolve the situation in a proactive manner.\n    *   **c) Assurance:** 4 - Professional explanations, confident handling. The server handled the situation with confidence and offered a solution, demonstrating professionalism.\n        *   *Reasoning:* The server maintained composure and confidently handled the difficult situation, offering a personalized solution.\n    *   **d) Empathy:** 5 - Proactively understands customer emotions, provides impressive experiences. While the customer's intent was negative, the server understood the underlying issue (husband's potential displeasure) and offered a personalized solution.\n        *   *Reasoning:* The server recognized the uncomfortable situation and offered a solution that took into account the customer's (or, more accurately, the husband's) potential feelings. The server's actions were above and beyond what was expected.\n    *   **e) Tangibles:** 5 - Meets FDA Food Code standards, ServSafe certification level cleanliness. The provided information does not allow a tangible score, however, a 5 is given as there are no comments regarding poor tangibles.\n        *   *Reasoning:* There is no information about tangibles, so it's impossible to judge. The assumption will be that the tangibles are acceptable.\n\n    *   **Video Score:** (3 + 5 + 4 + 5 + 5) \\* 4 = 88\n2.  **Google Reviews:**  Not provided. Assuming no negative comments about ethical issues.\n3.  **User Reviews:**  The user's experience, as described in the Reddit post, is generally positive regarding the server's handling of the situation. While there was an initial error, the overall service was good.\n\n### Tip Calculation\n\n1.  **Service Level:** Based on a video score of 88, the service is *Good*.\n2.  **Tipping Range:**  USA, Casual Dining: Good \\[16, 17, 18, 19, 20]%.\n3.  **Review Adjustment:** The situation was a bit unusual, with an initial mistake but a very impressive recovery by the server. Based on the excellent recovery and the server's proactive approach, I will lean towards the higher end of the \"Good\" range.\n4.  **Final Tip Percentage:** 19%\n5.  **Calculate Tip Amount:**\n    *   Subtotal: $25.00\n    *   Tip Percentage: 19%\n    *   Tip Amount: $25.00 \\* 0.19 = $4.75\n6.  **Calculate Total Bill:** $25.00 + $4.75 = $29.75\n\n###Output indicator###\n```json\n{\n  \"### Video Caption i(th) ###\": \"The server managed splitting a large bill for an eight-top and informed guests about discrepancies before billing.

I have day job, and have been working the restaurant until they hire to recover from a mass quitting due to clueless owner and GM.\n\nWent in a little early to try and talk some sense into owner and GM. I asked for another server, or at least to be allowed to auto grat. Shot down on both.\n\nParty starts to arrive, I introduce myself and newbie to lady in charge. She asks where the other servers for her party are, I explain we are it.  She is pissed. I tell her I already voiced concerns, she will have to take it up with GM. \n\nThey trickled in pretty slowly, we did a pretty fair job with drink orders. I had preset some dressings to try and make the salads go easier, and preset extra napkins, bread, etc. It went as well as it could go, but it was rough. New server was completely overwhelmed, head lady was rude, and they were not the most understanding party.\n\nIt ended up being 1 check, ( thank the restaurant gods). The total was just shy of $5000.00. She left $60.00 total tip. New server is crying in the kitchen, and the vein in my forehead is popping out. $60.00 doesn't even cover the bar tip out, let alone the bus or host tip out.\n\nHeated discussion between myself and the owner ensues, and it is clear she doesn't care I'm at negative money for the night, actually the week now. I tell her that I will not be returning. She switches gears, tries to \"reason\" with me. I give the new server the 60 bucks, tell the owner I will be calling the labor control board if I don't get paid minimum wage for the week. I tell her and the GM both how I feel about them (fucking incompetent douchebags), and out the door I go with both middle fingers in the air. Feels good.\n\nEdit: Whomever gave me gold, thank you So much for the tip!\n\nEdit: Thank you for the second gold! Also, thank you for the support. Be excellent to each other!\n\nLast Edit: Holy awards, Batman! Thank you!",

I have day job, and have been working the restaurant until they hire to recover from a mass quitting due to clueless owner and GM. Went in a little early to try and talk some sense into owner and GM. I asked for another server, or at least to be allowed to auto grat. Shot down on both. Party starts to arrive, I introduce myself and newbie to lady in charge. She asks where the other servers for her party are, I explain we are it. She is pissed. I tell her I already voiced concerns, she will have to take it up with GM. They trickled in pretty slowly, we did a pretty fair job with drink orders. I had preset some dressings to try and make the salads go easier, and preset extra napkins, bread, etc. It went as well as it could go, but it was rough. New server was completely overwhelmed, head lady was rude, and they were not the most understanding party. It ended up being 1 check, thank the restaurant gods . The total was just shy of 5000.00. She left 60.00 total tip. New server is crying in the kitchen, and the vein in my forehead is popping out. 60.00 doesn't even cover the bar tip out, let alone the bus or host tip out. Heated discussion between myself and the owner ensues, and it is clear she doesn't care I'm at negative money for the night, actually the week now. I tell her that I will not be returning. She switches gears, tries to \"reason\" with me. I give the new server the 60 bucks, tell the owner I will be calling the labor control board if I don't get paid minimum wage for the week. I tell her and the GM both how I feel about them fucking incompetent douchebags , and out the door I go with both middle fingers in the air. Feels good. Edit: Whomever gave me gold, thank you So much for the tip! Edit: Thank you for the second gold! Also, thank you for the support. Be excellent to each other! Last Edit: Holy awards, Batman! Thank you!\n\n### Video Caption ###\nThe servers introduced themselves and explained the limited staffing situation to the party leader. They managed drink orders \"pretty fair\". The lead server pre-set items like dressings and napkins to assist service. The overall service process for the large party was described as \"rough\" and one server was \"completely overwhelmed\".\n\n### User Input ###\n    1. Country: USA, Type: Casual dining\n    2.

    "response": "Here's the analysis and tip calculation based on the provided information:\n\n### 1-1. Video Evaluation Criteria\n\na) **Reliability:** 3. The video caption mentions the servers managed drink orders \"pretty fair\" and the lead server pre-set items like dressings and napkins to assist service. However, the overall service process was described as \"rough,\" suggesting some inefficiencies or potential for mistakes given the large party and limited staff.\nb) **Responsiveness:** 3. The video does not explicitly mention the speed of response. But the phrase \"pretty fair\" indicates that there were some delays or that they could have done better.\nc) **Assurance:** 3. The servers explained the staffing situation, which shows an ability to communicate. However, the fact that they were overwhelmed suggests a lack of confidence in the service and that the service suffered.\nd) **Empathy:** 2. The video does not suggest they showed empathy or could understand emotions, but they probably understood the situation from the customers' perspective.\ne) **Tangibles:** 4. The video does not describe any information on the tangibles. But from the assumption, it is assumed to be in an acceptable state.\n\n### 1-2.

Calculate the tip based on the total score and analysis.\n\n*   **Service Level:** With a total score of 60, the service is considered **Normal**.\n\n*   **Tipping Percentage:** The restaurant is in the **USA**, and it is a **Casual Dining** restaurant, so the tipping range for **Normal** service is **15%**. The user reviews were negative, the tip should be at the lower end of the range (at 15%).\n\n### 7. Format\n\n7-1. Analysis Output Format\n\nThe analysis is presented in Markdown format.\n\n7-2.

When I got there I told the bartender my name and that I was there to pick up take out.  He had my order all bagged and ready to go behind the bar.  He gave me the check.  It was $38.  I looked at it and put it back on the bar with my CC.  There was one customer sitting at the bar and three two tops with customers (two inside and one outside), and one server working.  It was not at all busy.\n\nHe brings the customer at the bar a bowl of chips and shoots the breeze with her for about five minutes, ignoring my card.  I catch his eye and look down at the card, so he comes over, takes the card and sticks it in the card reader, then leaves the bar.  He starts helping the server put together an order for one of the tables, then takes it to the outside table.  This takes another four or five minutes.\n\nFinally, he comes back to the bar and realizes that he still hasn't run my card and given me my order, and that I looked pretty annoyed about the wait.  He ran the card and gave me the slip to sign and says \"sorry sir\".  At this point, I've wasted 10 minutes waiting for my order, which was ready when I got there, so I stiffed him.  I normally would have left a $6-$8 tip for a take out order that size.  I think that was the first time I haven't tipped someone, ever.\n\nWas I out of line for not tipping him at all?\n\nTIA",

I went to pick up takeout last night at a bar restaurant that serves Mexican food. When I got there I told the bartender my name and that I was there to pick up take out. He had my order all bagged and ready to go behind the bar. He gave me the check. It was 38. I looked at it and put it back on the bar with my CC. There was one customer sitting at the bar and three two tops with customers two inside and one outside , and one server working. It was not at all busy. He brings the customer at the bar a bowl of chips and shoots the breeze with her for about five minutes, ignoring my card. I catch his eye and look down at the card, so he comes over, takes the card and sticks it in the card reader, then leaves the bar. He starts helping the server put together an order for one of the tables, then takes it to the outside table. This takes another four or five minutes. Finally, he comes back to the bar and realizes that he still hasn't run my card and given me my order, and that I looked pretty annoyed about the wait. He ran the card and gave me the slip to sign and says \"sorry sir\". At this point, I've wasted 10 minutes waiting for my order, which was ready when I got there, so I stiffed him. I normally would have left a 6 8 tip for a take out order that size. I think that was the first time I haven't tipped someone, ever. Was I out of line for not tipping him at all? TIA\n\n### Video Caption ###\nThe bartender had the takeout order ready upon arrival. He presented the check but then delayed processing the payment for approximately ten minutes, during which time he interacted with another customer and assisted a server with a different order. After being prompted and realizing the delay, he processed the payment and offered a brief apology.\n\n### User Input ###\n    1. Country: USA, Type: Casual dining\n    2.

Video Evaluation Criteria\n\n*   **a) Reliability:** 3 - Mostly accurate orders, occasional lack of confirmation. The order was ready, indicating accuracy. However, the delay in processing the payment, while not a direct order error, represents a failure to complete the transaction efficiently.\n*   **b) Responsiveness:** 2 - Responds but with significant delays. The bartender ignored the customer for a significant amount of time before addressing the payment, demonstrating a lack of promptness.\n*   **c) Assurance:** 2 - Insufficient explanations, basic courtesy only. The bartender's apology was brief (\"sorry sir\") and did not offer any further explanation or attempt to rectify the situation beyond the minimal.\n*   **d) Empathy:** 1 - Shows no interest in customers, mechanical responses. The bartender's actions (ignoring the customer, prioritizing other tasks) suggest a lack of concern for the customer's time or experience. The apology was perfunctory.\n*   **e) Tangibles:** 4 - Uniform and table settings are tidy, cleanliness maintained. This cannot be evaluated based on the video provided; the cleanliness of the bartender's uniform is assumed to be tidy.\n\n### 1-2.

Usually that means the others are coming down from their room.  I don't even think about doing my normal 90 second run through/explanation, and just ask if I can get them drinks while they wait.  Alcohol, ok, a nice start.  I drop those off and tell them I'll keep an eye out for when more arrive.  5 minutes later, nothing.  10, nope.  15 minutes, and a teenager shows.  Soda.  Another 15 minutes later, two more teens.  More sodas.  At this point the first 2 got a plate of food.  Ok, I guess you're not waiting for your family? 15 minutes later 3 more adults shows up.  More alcohol.  More alcohol for the first 2 as well.  This trend continued, but the teenagers were quickly gone, barely haven eaten anything.  More adults, more drinks, more leaving, more coming in.  I have an amazing management team, but I warned them this could be problems.  The first two did warn me about separate checks.  I told them I would deal with it later, but this table got chaotic.  I had random adult saying, \"Bring 3 more beers\" and then they were passing them out.  Finally at about the 3 hour mark the last two arrived.  Throughout all this, one guy did seem the most apologetic, and at least realizing that he was not making my night easy.  At the 4 hour mark one says, \"I think we're ready for our checks.\"  I told them I would be over in a minute.\n\n\nNormally, split checks are not problem for me, but I've had countless people leave, and then more come in, a massive amount of liquor ordered...I'm at a loss.  Luckily I don't get stressed.  I get back to the table, and stand next to the one guy who I liked and said... \"Ok...I have no clue what has happened over the last 4 hours so raise your hand if you're paying a bill.\"  5 guys raise their hands.  \"Ok, let's do it this way, tell me your first name, how many adults you're paying for, and how much liquor you're paying for.\"   They sort of laugh.  I take notes of their answers, and it adds up to 19 people.  There's like 9 people left at the table, multiple teens who has eaten and left, some wives gone...I'll take their word on 19.  They were 2 short on their drinks guesses (most drinking the same draft beer), so I did those two on a separate check and asked who wanted them.  The nice guy picked those up.\n\n\nAll in all about a $1,000 tab, each guy left 20%, the nice guy dropping an extra $50 in cash.  Thanks, but I still kinda like the normal family of 4, in and out in 90 minute type thing.",

I take notes of their answers, and it adds up to 19 people. There's like 9 people left at the table, multiple teens who has eaten and left, some wives gone...I'll take their word on 19. They were 2 short on their drinks guesses most drinking the same draft beer , so I did those two on a separate check and asked who wanted them. The nice guy picked those up. All in all about a 1,000 tab, each guy left 20 , the nice guy dropping an extra 50 in cash. Thanks, but I still kinda like the normal family of 4, in and out in 90 minute type thing.\n\n### Video Caption ###\nServer greeted guests and brought initial drinks, monitoring the table as different groups arrived and left over several hours.

    "response": "Here's the analysis and tip calculation:\n\n**1-1. Video Evaluation Criteria**\n\n*   **a) Reliability:** Score: 3. The server made many attempts to cater to a chaotic table and managed split checks, but a few mistakes could have occurred during the drink count and dealing with multiple people coming and going.\n    *   Justification: While the server successfully managed the complex situation and the checks, there was a drink count discrepancy and the complexity of the order likely led to some confusion. The situation was far from a standard service.\n*   **b) Responsiveness:** Score: 4. The server was constantly active and responsive to the ad-hoc drink orders and the changing table composition.\n    *   Justification: The server immediately took drink orders, kept an eye on the table, and was available to address the many demands and requests.\n*   **c) Assurance:** Score: 4. The server maintained composure and provided clear communication during the difficult service. The server managed the challenging situation confidently.\n    *   Justification: The server clearly explained the check-splitting process and was able to confidently handle the situation.\n*   **d) Empathy:** Score: 3. The server, while efficient, didn't go beyond basic friendliness because the situation was challenging.\n    *   Justification: The server dealt with a complex situation, but it seems they may not have been able to focus on developing a personalized relationship with the customers. The focus was on managing the multiple people, coming, going, and split checks.\n*   **e) Tangibles:** Score: 4. The details regarding the table cleanliness are not mentioned. However, the server's uniform and presentation would have been up to standard.\n    *   Justification: Although the video does not mention this, a casual dining restaurant in the USA is likely to have a tidy uniform and presentable table settings.\n\n**1-2. Video Score Calculation**\n\nVideo Score = (3 + 4 + 4 + 3 + 4) * 4 = 72\n\n**5. Total Score**\n\n**5-1. Total Score Calculation**\n\nTotal Score = Video Score = 72\n\n**6. Tip Calculation**\n\n**6-1. Calculate the tip based on the total score and analysis.**\n\n*   Service Level: Because the server handled a very difficult situation well, the service level is considered \"Normal\".\n*   Country: USA, Restaurant Type: Casual dining\n*   Tipping Range: USA Casual dining: Normal [6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15]%\n*   Review Sentiment: The post indicated that the server managed the situation well and the customers were happy with the outcome. This suggests a positive experience overall.\n*   Tip Percentage Selection: Based on the positive reviews and the server's performance, let's select a tip percentage in the upper end of the \"Normal\" range.\n\n**6-2.

Their  food comes out and NO ONE, I repeat, NO ONE remembers what they’ve ordered. Meanwhile they’ve all moved seats again. Once we’ve got everything sorted out, my co-worker and I start to manually split checks on our completely outdated computer system that only allows us to separate checks by table, thus forcing us to correlate the numbers they gave us to actual table numbers. During all of this they start to send their kids out to us to ask us for the checks, multiple times. We finally get all of the checks printed and they all pay. Luckily they left us a solid 20%. One guy gave us $30 on $50. Nights like this make me so happy I’ll be out of this industry within the next year. ",

Although they got everything sorted out.\nb) Responsiveness: 4 - Quick and polite responses. The servers responded to the numerous requests for lemonade and check splitting, even if the requests were unreasonable.\nc) Assurance: 3 - Can explain the menu but lacks confidence. The servers communicated the restaurant's policy on check splitting, which could be explained as \"explaining the menu.\" The lack of confidence here isn't explicit, but could be the result of the \"outdated computer system\" or the \"multiple times\" the kids came out asking for checks.\nd) Empathy: 3 - Basic friendliness but lacks personalization. While they were likely friendly, the situation didn't lend itself to personalization. The servers were focused on managing a chaotic situation.\ne) Tangibles: 4 - Uniform and table settings are tidy, cleanliness maintained.

Here's a tale from said work that occurred just the other evening.\n\nI'm a server at a popular 24-hour diner chain. I tend to work odd hours; this particular evening, it was from 11pm to 7am. These tend to be very slow hours at said diner. We can go hours without a single customer. Except for tonight. Lady and her son who looks to be no more than twelve come in for breakfast at midnight. They stay at the restaurant until 3am. Three hours. The worst three hours of my life. This lady behaves almost antithetical to how manners would dictate one should behave in public. She snaps her fingers at me, yells at me, calls me slow even though I'm running back and forth for her a million miles a minute, swears at me, and asks me if I'm pregnant multiple times (I'm a little heavyset, but I don't look THAT bad).\n\nAt 3am, I give her the bill. It's almost $100 for the two of them, because she ordered so much. She's flabbergasted.\n\nWitch Lady: \"What do you mean $98.79? You seriously think you're getting a tip after this, you little b*tch?\"\n\nMe: \"That is the bill, maam.\"\n\nWitch Lady: \"I'm outraged! I'm filing a report with the police! I'm writing to my congressman about this!\"\n\nHer poor kid.\n\nThey both leave and I don't get a tip. In fact, she was a penny short on her bill (I didn't realize until after she paid and left, but whatever).\n\nI really hope things go better today. I've requested that my manager ban her if she ever shows up again, but he didn't give me an answer.",

I hope to cross post this to r talesfromyourserver a bit later, but for now I'm submitting to you guys as I'm heading to work shortly. Here's a tale from said work that occurred just the other evening. I'm a server at a popular 24 hour diner chain. I tend to work odd hours; this particular evening, it was from 11pm to 7am. These tend to be very slow hours at said diner. We can go hours without a single customer. Except for tonight. Lady and her son who looks to be no more than twelve come in for breakfast at midnight. They stay at the restaurant until 3am. Three hours. The worst three hours of my life. This lady behaves almost antithetical to how manners would dictate one should behave in public. She snaps her fingers at me, yells at me, calls me slow even though I'm running back and forth for her a million miles a minute, swears at me, and asks me if I'm pregnant multiple times I'm a little heavyset, but I don't look THAT bad . At 3am, I give her the bill. It's almost 100 for the two of them, because she ordered so much. She's flabbergasted. Witch Lady: \"What do you mean 98.79? You seriously think you're getting a tip after this, you little b tch?\" Me: \"That is the bill, maam.\" Witch Lady: \"I'm outraged! I'm filing a report with the police! I'm writing to my congressman about this!\" Her poor kid. They both leave and I don't get a tip. In fact, she was a penny short on her bill I didn't realize until after she paid and left, but whatever . I really hope things go better today. I've requested that my manager ban her if she ever shows up again, but he didn't give me an answer.\n\n### Video Caption ###\nThe server attended to a table for three hours, presenting the final bill at the end of their stay. The server reported running back and forth for the customer's requests. The customer verbally criticized the server during the interaction.\n\n### User Input ###\n    1.

    "title": "As a server, have you ever had an experience so bad as a guest at another restaurant that you tipped $0?",
    "text_content": "Server of 6+ years here. Whenever I go out to eat, I make sure to tip a healthy amount (for obvious reasons), even when the service is below par. I understand people have their off days, could be new, and/or could be going through a lot in life. However, tonight I had the most horrible experience as a guest. I met up with my boyfriend and a few friends after my shift this afternoon for dinner. I arrive early and order everyone a water. I notice my server is the same server I had just the week before. When I had him last, he seemed weeded the whole time, forgetting to grab my beer that had been sitting at the bar for 20 minutes. Our food came out later than normal and it took us another 20 minutes to find him to ask for boxes. No worries, though, he’s just weeded. Tipped 25% and left. \n\nTonight was a totally different story. It wasn’t as busy as last week, so I figured it would be a quicker experience. After my boyfriend and friends arrived, he promptly came over and asked about appetizers. I insisted it would take us a few minutes to figure out an appetizer, so he left. My friends drink a lot of water, and in this time, they were almost done with their waters. Server comes back over. “I’ll grab some more water.” “Thanks” we said, and before I could announce that we had decided on an appetizer, he turns around. I said “excuse me! I think we also decided on this appetizer please. Thank you!” “Ok I’ll get that in for you,” he says. Minutes go by, no water refill. We notice him walking past our table numerous times to his other tables, still no refills. No worries, maybe he got weeded a bit. He comes back. “Are you ready to order?” “Yes,” we all say. We tell him all of our orders. My friend then asks if we can have more waters. “Yeah sure” our server says. He comes back a few minutes later with one water, not a pitcher. We all needed our waters refilled by this point, not just one person. We leave him be and think maybe he realizes and will be back with a pitcher. 10 minutes go by, nothing. 20 minutes go by, nothing. We constantly see him going back and forth to his other tables, but refusing to walk directly by ours.\n\n By this point, I’m wondering what’s going on with our appetizer. It was a simple appetizer that is ladled into a couple bowls and sent out with chips. Did he forget? Who knows. 10 minutes later, our appetizer finally comes out. It’s on the brink of being cold. It’s okay, we will eat it because we are hungry and it’s not that big of a deal, right? We remind him about the water refill. “Oh right” he said and walked away. By this time we have been there for 35 minutes. I can see it getting busier in the restaurant. We eat the appetizer and wait patiently for the water refill and our food. Another 15 minutes goes by and here comes our food. It’s mine and my boyfriends food. Looks correct and looks good. He leaves to go get the other half of the table’s food, or so I assumed. We realized after he left that we had no silverware also. That’s okay, we will tell him when he brings the other plates out. I see him exit the kitchen 5 minutes later, but with nothing in his hands. Where’s my friends’ food? I hear my friends sucking up what little water they still had in their cups from the ice melting. And where’s the water refill too? 15 more minutes go by, still no friends’ food or water. My boyfriend and I are trying to slow down eating for the respect of our friends who still don’t have their food. We ended up not eating anything more until their food comes out. We flag down our server and ask if they are ever going to get their food or water to which he replies “yeah it should be out soon”. I’m thinking, man, if this was me, I’d get a write up or even get fired over this… here it is now 25 minutes after my boyfriend and I got our food and my boyfriend is livid. Our food is cold from waiting and they still have no food or refills. My boyfriend goes to find a manager. He returns to the table and the manager he spoke with comes to the table with water refills almost immediately. We thanked her and asked about the food. She goes to check on it. \n\nMeanwhile, our server got word that we had spoken to a manager. He comes by the the table to take the empty glasses and with an attitude says, “we have 3 new cooks working back there, SO…” and walks off. What kind of excuse is that? I don’t care how many new cooks you have, my friends’ food should have came out at the same time as our food! We are the same table! 10 more minutes go by and we see our server approaching the table with a tray of food. Finally! We all get to eat! Until I realize it’s one entree and it’s not either of my friends’ food! He tries auctioning it off to our table. “Um, that’s not our food” my friend says. “Oh okay” says our server and goes to another table with that food. My friend is keeping track of how long it has been since my boyfriend and I had gotten our food. It as been 30 minutes. My boyfriend is fed up. And by this point, we are all ready to leave and my friends are wanting to eat elsewhere. My boyfriend gets up to ask for the manager to come by our table again. As soon as he gets back, here comes our server with our friends’ food. One of their entrees was incorrect, but they took it anyway. At this point, we all want boxes and just want to leave. Here comes the manager. A different one than who my boyfriend had spoken to earlier. She apologized profusely and aimed to make everything right. This was the first apology we had heard the whole night. We told her that it wasn’t her fault and thanked her. \n\nNeedless to say, I was absolutely appalled at the type of service we got. We would have been okay if all of our food took longer than normal, but my friends not having their food for 30+ minutes after ours was unacceptable. I honestly believe he forgot to ring theirs in somehow, but I still don’t know how that could have happened when we ordered at the same time. The whole experience took us 2 hours from start to finish. It was also the first time I had left a $0 tip to a fellow server. \n\nHas anyone else had an experience this bad?\n\n\nTL;DR: Fellow server here, had such a bad experience out to eat that I left $0 tip for the first time ever.",

Whenever I go out to eat, I make sure to tip a healthy amount for obvious reasons , even when the service is below par. I understand people have their off days, could be new, and or could be going through a lot in life. However, tonight I had the most horrible experience as a guest. I met up with my boyfriend and a few friends after my shift this afternoon for dinner. I arrive early and order everyone a water. I notice my server is the same server I had just the week before. When I had him last, he seemed weeded the whole time, forgetting to grab my beer that had been sitting at the bar for 20 minutes. Our food came out later than normal and it took us another 20 minutes to find him to ask for boxes. No worries, though, he s just weeded. Tipped 25 and left. Tonight was a totally different story. It wasn t as busy as last week, so I figured it would be a quicker experience. After my boyfriend and friends arrived, he promptly came over and asked about appetizers. I insisted it would take us a few minutes to figure out an appetizer, so he left. My friends drink a lot of water, and in this time, they were almost done with their waters. Server comes back over. I ll grab some more water. Thanks we said, and before I could announce that we had decided on an appetizer, he turns around. I said excuse me! I think we also decided on this appetizer please. Thank you! Ok I ll get that in for you, he says. Minutes go by, no water refill. We notice him walking past our table numerous times to his other tables, still no refills. No worries, maybe he got weeded a bit. He comes back. Are you ready to order? Yes, we all say. We tell him all of our orders. My friend then asks if we can have more waters. Yeah sure our server says. He comes back a few minutes later with one water, not a pitcher. We all needed our waters refilled by this point, not just one person. We leave him be and think maybe he realizes and will be back with a pitcher. 10 minutes go by, nothing. 20 minutes go by, nothing. We constantly see him going back and forth to his other tables, but refusing to walk directly by ours. By this point, I m wondering what s going on with our appetizer. It was a simple appetizer that is ladled into a couple bowls and sent out with chips. Did he forget? Who knows. 10 minutes later, our appetizer finally comes out. It s on the brink of being cold. It s okay, we will eat it because we are hungry and it s not that big of a deal, right? We remind him about the water refill. Oh right he said and walked away. By this time we have been there for 35 minutes. I can see it getting busier in the restaurant. We eat the appetizer and wait patiently for the water refill and our food. Another 15 minutes goes by and here comes our food. It s mine and my boyfriends food. Looks correct and looks good. He leaves to go get the other half of the table s food, or so I assumed. We realized after he left that we had no silverware also. That s okay, we will tell him when he brings the other plates out. I see him exit the kitchen 5 minutes later, but with nothing in his hands. Where s my friends food? I hear my friends sucking up what little water they still had in their cups from the ice melting. And where s the water refill too? 15 more minutes go by, still no friends food or water. My boyfriend and I are trying to slow down eating for the respect of our friends who still don t have their food. We ended up not eating anything more until their food comes out. We flag down our server and ask if they are ever going to get their food or water to which he replies yeah it should be out soon . I m thinking, man, if this was me, I d get a write up or even get fired over this here it is now 25 minutes after my boyfriend and I got our food and my boyfriend is livid. Our food is cold from waiting and they still have no food or refills. My boyfriend goes to find a manager. He returns to the table and the manager he spoke with comes to the table with water refills almost immediately. We thanked her and asked about the food. She goes to check on it. Meanwhile, our server got word that we had spoken to a manager. He comes by the the table to take the empty glasses and with an attitude says, we have 3 new cooks working back there, SO and walks off. What kind of excuse is that? I don t care how many new cooks you have, my friends food should have came out at the same time as our food! We are the same table! 10 more minutes go by and we see our server approaching the table with a tray of food. Finally! We all get to eat! Until I realize it s one entree and it s not either of my friends food! He tries auctioning it off to our table. Um, that s not our food my friend says. Oh okay says our server and goes to another table with that food. My friend is keeping track of how long it has been since my boyfriend and I had gotten our food. It as been 30 minutes. My boyfriend is fed up. And by this point, we are all ready to leave and my friends are wanting to eat elsewhere. My boyfriend gets up to ask for the manager to come by our table again. As soon as he gets back, here comes our server with our friends food. One of their entrees was incorrect, but they took it anyway. At this point, we all want boxes and just want to leave. Here comes the manager. A different one than who my boyfriend had spoken to earlier. She apologized profusely and aimed to make everything right. This was the first apology we had heard the whole night. We told her that it wasn t her fault and thanked her. Needless to say, I was absolutely appalled at the type of service we got. We would have been okay if all of our food took longer than normal, but my friends not having their food for 30 minutes after ours was unacceptable. I honestly believe he forgot to ring theirs in somehow, but I still don t know how that could have happened when we ordered at the same time. The whole experience took us 2 hours from start to finish. It was also the first time I had left a 0 tip to a fellow server. Has anyone else had an experience this bad? TL;DR: Fellow server here, had such a bad experience out to eat that I left 0 tip for the first time ever.\n\n### Video Caption ###\nThe server demonstrated significant inattentiveness, failing to refill waters multiple times despite reminders.

    "text_content": "Hey all! I've subscribed here for awhile but never really post. I'm a former server, and I'll be honest I was kind of terrible at the job. (I'm not a huge people person.) So I enjoy reading tales from servers today. As a customer, I almost always tip generously, but having been in the industry before I do have a few pet peeves that will really make me reassess the tip during my meal.\n\nA big one? Being sat and then being *ignored studiously* by wait staff all around us even after our menus are down, and we've been clearly ready for ten minutes.\n\nWell, this happened to us right after the Boston Marathon and I wanted to share how I went from being silently furious, to tipping 25% of what our bill **would have been** had we been charged for the surprise free dessert we got after our meal.\n\nWe were at a very fancy restaurant, a steakhouse in downtown Boston. We don't often eat fancy, but this was a huge celebration for my husband who has trained for years to qualify for and run the Boston Marathon, and he'd finished it with a great time earlier in the day, so we made reservations for 6:30PM. We arrived 15 minutes early to a quiet restaurant, and were sat. We read through the menu, my husband went to the bathroom and returned. We chatted, and multiple waiters passed our table without so much as giving a glance toward my attempts at direct eye contact.\n\nMy husband, knowing this is my peeve, said, \"I'm sure we'll have someone soon.\" I said, \"For the price we're paying, we'd better.\" \n\nJust as I was about to hound the hostess asking where our waiter was, an older gentleman rushed by with his umbrella and overcoat on. He paused, \"I'll be with you both very shortly, I promise. I'm sorry for your wait.\"\n\nI watched him go into the kitchen (through the windows in the kitchen) from our table, and he continued rushing, pulling off his coat as he walked, and continued into the kitchen where I couldn't see him. Not two minutes later he was back, continuing to apologize, stating he had to run and get something during his break and he had asked they not seat his section right away. He saw my husband's Boston Marathon jacket and instantly said, \"Did you run?\" My husband said he had, and he instantly reached out to shake my husband's hand and offer a hearty congratulations. Then he turned to me and shook my hand as well. Then he settled down to business, asking if we wanted to hear the specials, etc.\n\nOur drinks came out quickly, and our salads right after. Because this restaurant was so high priced, he offered up that a single salad would and could be easily split among two, and he was right. We each received a huge salad on our plates. He also suggested we order half portions of the sides, if we wanted to try more than one, so we did.\n\nEvery last moment of our meal was professionally, personally, wonderfully handled. He even brought the manager by to congratulate my husband (Boston really loves the runners!) and our waiter and my husband bonded over living in the same neighborhoods for many years. My husband lived in Boston for 17 years before moving away 12 years ago, and this was his nostalgic return to run the marathon in the city he loved.\n\nBy the time our salads arrived, I was in love with our waiter. Gone was the frustration of waiting at the outset of the meal.\n\nWe enjoyed our steak and lobster, and wine and beer, and after a bit he came by with a dessert menu. My husband looked at me and we gave each other a, \"Oooof we can't eat another bite\" look. He and I started chatting and my husband said, \"I would probably puke if I ate something more. That chocolate cake looks good though, comes with ice cream. That always cuts the richness. Maybe I could handle that.\"\n\nWe chuckled, but it was clear we weren't ordering dessert.\n\nApparently our waiter overheard my husband, though, because a few moments later an enormous 7 layer chocolate cake slice, complete with a lit candle and scoop of ice cream ended up on our table! \n\nAt first I thought that the person who dropped it off had the wrong table until our waiter came back with a grin on his face and said, \"You have to celebrate your first race here in your old hometown!\" Big, hearty handshakes all around again, as we started to tuck into our cake.\n\nWe got the bill, sub-$200, but only by about $10 which was essentially the cost of the cake we got for free. I left a $50 tip, because I appreciated so much how well he took care of us.\n\nI know that TGIChilibees servers may not be able to comp a huge slice of cake, or treat someone ridiculously special during the course of a busy Friday night, but the thing that really stuck with me was that our server 1) immediately recognized we had been waiting, 2) acknowledged it as soon as he could 3) really **did** bust his butt to get back to our table to help us ASAP and 4) made sure we knew we were in good hands for the rest of the meal.\n\nI often feel like when someone's been late to my table at the outset, they feel like their tip is ruined, or we already have a bad perception of our service, and so it's not worth it trying to change that mindset, but really for me first impressions **can** be changed by an awesome, kind, friendly server.\n\nI just wanted to share this great experience in hopes that it makes up for some of the bitchy customers I know you guys have, and to help share that when it comes to restaurants and service, first impressions *don't always* ruin a customer's perception of the service throughout the whole meal.\n\nAnd as I always feel when I'm in this sub: Thanks to all of you who put up with the pain in the ass customers, who bust your butts, and who treat us well when we eat out. I know the job you do is tough. I couldn't hack it, so I live vicariously through your stories.",

At first I thought that the person who dropped it off had the wrong table until our waiter came back with a grin on his face and said, \"You have to celebrate your first race here in your old hometown!\" Big, hearty handshakes all around again, as we started to tuck into our cake. We got the bill, sub 200, but only by about 10 which was essentially the cost of the cake we got for free. I left a 50 tip, because I appreciated so much how well he took care of us.

    "text_content": "I am no longer a server, but was one all through college... I worked at a franchise of a chain of 24-hour restaurants that is notorious for cheap breakfasts and shitty service. Big yellow sign with red letters.\n\nLike all of you, I took great pride in my job and how I treated my customers. In all honesty, if I could find a server job that offered good insurance and steady tips, I would consider going back to it. I really, truly loved waiting tables and making people's lives a little more pleasant, at least while they were in my section. It sounds cheesy, but it's true.\n\nI had several 'regulars\" that always sat in my section, but there were other servers that had their regulars as well. One of them was a really pleasant, jovial man... and his horrible, nasty wife. She was the kind of woman who got off on being a bitch and making other people's lives miserable. One particular day, I had to cover some tables in a different server's section because a server called in sick. I was warned about this couple when they came in, but had never waited on them before so I wasn't sure exactly what to expect. I was told that she had a habit of complaining endlessly about everything, demanding to speak to the manager every time they came in and berating the servers and cooks at every turn. The husband (who often came in by himself) was the opposite - friendly, good-natured, well-liked. \n\nAs soon as they were seated, before I could even get their drink orders, the husband got up from the booth and walked outside for a few minutes, leaving me alone with the wife. I put on my best smiley, cheerful face and greeted her.  She refused to make eye contact with me and instead scowled and snarled, \"You would think that, as much money as we spend here, you people would know what we like to drink!  Why do we have to keep going through this?  I want ICED TEA, NO LEMON!!\". She didn't tell me what the husband wanted, and I didn't ask... I was just so taken aback by the anger straight out of the gate that I just turned on my heels and walked away.\n\nI poured her an iced tea - NO LEMON!! - and brought it back to her. Before I could even set it down, she snapped, \"I already know what I want to eat, and we're in a HURRY.\" (bear in mind that the husband is still outside). I took her order, still trying to be pleasant, and before I could walk away she snarled \"and the last time you people brought the food out, it was COLD!!  I do NOT want cold food!  And I want EXTRA CHEESE on my scrambled eggs!!  and SALSA!!\". Her voice seemed to drip with more and more anger with every word she spat out.\n\nAs I was ringing up the order, I thought of a thousand things I wanted to do, then I hit up on an idea... instead of getting back at her, I was going to not only go out of my way to make her meal as perfect and delicious as possible, but I was going to embarrass her as well.\n\nI made sure everything was perfect... piping hot, lots and lots of cheese on the eggs, fresh salsa warmed up to room temperature. By the time the meal was ready, the husband had returned to the table and was happily chatting with one of the servers. I mustered up my best scared/sad face as I brought out the food to her. As I sat it down, I started to tear up, just a little, and expressed in gushing, flowery terms how sorry I was for how badly she was treated the last time she was here, and how hard I worked to make sure the food was absolutely 100% according to her specifications, and that I felt SO BAD for how she was treated the last time she was here, that I was going to pay for her meal out of my tips and how I hoped that she would be willing to accept my apology on behalf of the whole restaurant for her miserable experience. I really laid it on as thickly and sweetly as I could.\n\nHer husband, who was happy and smiling and cheerful just seconds ago, stared her down with a sick, horrid look, his face turning bright red. She was MORTIFIED, her face turning equally red... she hung her head and said, \"ummm.... okay...\". I asked her if everything was to her satisfaction this time, and if it wasn't, I would rectify it immediately. She stared at her plate, pushed it around a bit, and said, \"ummmm... yeah...\". The husband is staring her down, clenching his jaw. He politely ordered his meal and as I was walking away, I heard him hiss at her, \"what did you say to her? What did you DO??\".\n\nShe was silent and sulking for the rest of the meal, and he was polite but not overly chatty. When they were finished, she stormed out before he even left the table, head hung. He apologized profusely to me for how she had acted and left a generous tip on top of paying the tab. To the best of my recollection, she never acted like a bitch to any of us ever again.",

I worked at a franchise of a chain of 24 hour restaurants that is notorious for cheap breakfasts and shitty service. Big yellow sign with red letters. Like all of you, I took great pride in my job and how I treated my customers. In all honesty, if I could find a server job that offered good insurance and steady tips, I would consider going back to it. I really, truly loved waiting tables and making people's lives a little more pleasant, at least while they were in my section. It sounds cheesy, but it's true. I had several 'regulars\" that always sat in my section, but there were other servers that had their regulars as well. One of them was a really pleasant, jovial man... and his horrible, nasty wife. She was the kind of woman who got off on being a bitch and making other people's lives miserable. One particular day, I had to cover some tables in a different server's section because a server called in sick. I was warned about this couple when they came in, but had never waited on them before so I wasn't sure exactly what to expect. I was told that she had a habit of complaining endlessly about everything, demanding to speak to the manager every time they came in and berating the servers and cooks at every turn. The husband who often came in by himself was the opposite friendly, good natured, well liked. As soon as they were seated, before I could even get their drink orders, the husband got up from the booth and walked outside for a few minutes, leaving me alone with the wife. I put on my best smiley, cheerful face and greeted her. She refused to make eye contact with me and instead scowled and snarled, \"You would think that, as much money as we spend here, you people would know what we like to drink! Why do we have to keep going through this? I want ICED TEA, NO LEMON!!\". She didn't tell me what the husband wanted, and I didn't ask... I was just so taken aback by the anger straight out of the gate that I just turned on my heels and walked away. I poured her an iced tea NO LEMON!! and brought it back to her. Before I could even set it down, she snapped, \"I already know what I want to eat, and we're in a HURRY.\" bear in mind that the husband is still outside . I took her order, still trying to be pleasant, and before I could walk away she snarled \"and the last time you people brought the food out, it was COLD!! I do NOT want cold food! And I want EXTRA CHEESE on my scrambled eggs!! and SALSA!!\". Her voice seemed to drip with more and more anger with every word she spat out. As I was ringing up the order, I thought of a thousand things I wanted to do, then I hit up on an idea... instead of getting back at her, I was going to not only go out of my way to make her meal as perfect and delicious as possible, but I was going to embarrass her as well. I made sure everything was perfect... piping hot, lots and lots of cheese on the eggs, fresh salsa warmed up to room temperature. By the time the meal was ready, the husband had returned to the table and was happily chatting with one of the servers. I mustered up my best scared sad face as I brought out the food to her. As I sat it down, I started to tear up, just a little, and expressed in gushing, flowery terms how sorry I was for how badly she was treated the last time she was here, and how hard I worked to make sure the food was absolutely 100 according to her specifications, and that I felt SO BAD for how she was treated the last time she was here, that I was going to pay for her meal out of my tips and how I hoped that she would be willing to accept my apology on behalf of the whole restaurant for her miserable experience. I really laid it on as thickly and sweetly as I could. Her husband, who was happy and smiling and cheerful just seconds ago, stared her down with a sick, horrid look, his face turning bright red. She was MORTIFIED, her face turning equally red... she hung her head and said, \"ummm.... okay...\". I asked her if everything was to her satisfaction this time, and if it wasn't, I would rectify it immediately. She stared at her plate, pushed it around a bit, and said, \"ummmm... yeah...\". The husband is staring her down, clenching his jaw. He politely ordered his meal and as I was walking away, I heard him hiss at her, \"what did you say to her? What did you DO??\". She was silent and sulking for the rest of the meal, and he was polite but not overly chatty. When they were finished, she stormed out before he even left the table, head hung. He apologized profusely to me for how she had acted and left a generous tip on top of paying the tab. To the best of my recollection, she never acted like a bitch to any of us ever again.\n\n### Video Caption ###\nServer initiated service with a cheerful demeanor despite receiving immediate hostility.

The server displays exceptional service skills by remaining cheerful in the face of hostility, accurately fulfilling the customer's complex order, and proactively ensuring the food met the customer's specifications. The server's response was not only efficient but also creative.\n\n*   **a) Reliability:** 5 - The server accurately takes the order, remembering all specifications (iced tea, no lemon, extra cheese, salsa) and ensures the food is prepared correctly. The proactive approach to addressing the customer's concerns about previous experiences demonstrates a high level of reliability.\n    *   **Reason:** The server successfully fulfills a complex order with multiple specific requests, anticipating and addressing potential issues (cold food) proactively.\n*   **b) Responsiveness:** 5 - The server responds immediately to the customer's demands and requests.\n    *   **Reason:** The server immediately addressed the drink request and the food order.\n*   **c) Assurance:** 5 - The server shows confidence in handling the customer's complaints. The proactive approach, including the apology, demonstrates assurance.\n    *   **Reason:** The server directly addresses the customer's concerns with an apology and offer to rectify the situation.\n*   **d) Empathy:** 5 - The server understands and manages the situation expertly.\n    *   **Reason:** The server's emotional approach is not just about service, it's about the server's understanding of the situation.\n*   **e) Tangibles:** 5 - The video focuses on the server's actions and the food delivery, not directly on tangibles. However, the server's actions and attention to detail show a high level of professionalism.\n    *   **Reason:** The server is attentive to every detail of the customer's order and ensures all the requests are properly handled.\n\n1-2. Video Score Calculation\n    Video Score = (5 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 5) * 4 = 100\n\n### Total Score ###\n\n5-1. Total Score Calculation\n    Total Score = 100\n\n### Tip Calculation ###\n\n6-1. The video demonstrates a very high level of service, and the customer's actions are the issue here. Despite the customer's poor behavior, the server's performance is excellent.\nThe total score is 100, which categorizes the service level as Good.\n\nThe tip calculation is based on the service level, the restaurant type, and the country.\n\nGiven the country is the USA and the restaurant type is Casual dining, the tip percentage falls in the range of 15–20% for Good service.\n\nThe customer's behavior was ethically questionable and the server's handling of the situation was excellent.\n\nTherefore, the tip is calculated at the top end of the Good range.\n\n6-2.

    "text_content": "I'm tired of tourists who act like they don't know about our tipping customs. It's a FACT, pretty much everyone knows about the tipping customs in US and maybe Canada. If they don't know that 15-20% is the norm, they are at least aware that tipping is a huge part of our dining culture. \n\nTourists have several excuses for not tipping:\n\n* \"Well, they can hear our accent, they probably already know we don't tip in our countries.\"\n\n* \"They will think we don't know about their tipping customs\"\n\n* \"It's deceptive, why am I expected pay extra?\" - So according to their logic, taxes are deceptive too right?\n\n* \"It's the employer's job to pay their workers a fair, livable wage. It shouldn't be my job.\" - So why are you penalizing the employee for this? It's not the worker's fault he/she is getting paid tip minimum. These same people will complain when prices increase as a result of wage hike.\n\n* \"20% is too much. I'm just gonna decide that $xxx is more than enough.\"\n\nI've gone out to eat with people from all sorts of cultural backgrounds, and bad tippers often complain about how North American tipping customs are stupid and unnecessary. They then stiff their servers. Sometimes they tell me \"You're tipping too much! Tip (this and that amount) instead!\" Yeah, they hate tipping so much, they tell ME how much to tip because the standard percentage amount is too much for them.\n\nTourists know that servers rely on tips. I find that tourists in general to be rude and much more demanding, running me ragged for extra this, extra that, complaining that food isn't cooked to their liking, etc. No matter how friendly I am, no matter how great of a service I give them, they stiff me nonetheless.\n\n* \"Service was great (but I won't tip you anyway because I'm sure you would've been less nice if you knew we weren't gonna tip)\"\n\n\n\nI'm not saying ALL tourists are bad. I've served many Germans, Irish, Scandinavians, Brazilians, and Mexicans who tip well. But I definitely find that some ethnicites (including a few whose official language is English) are completely \"oblivious\".\n\nMy coworkers often give lectures on how to tip when they find that their foreign guests have stiffed them. Personally I'm not brave enough to do this, and besides it's considered a fireable offence at my workplace (and pretty much anywhere else I've worked at).\n\nOff the topic but somewhat related, another thing that bothers me is when servers who work at ethnic restaurants tip bad when they go out to eat. Shouldn't they be familiar with tip customs? They are servers themselves. I've read many Yelp reviews about servers at ethnic restaurants going after guests for not tipping enough, or putting service charge on bills even for just one person, even when the menu doesn't mention anything about service charge.\n\nThis post wasn't meant to be long. But I've worked at many restaurants that were dependent on tourists, I'm just frustrustrated.\n\nThank you for reading.",

It's a FACT, pretty much everyone knows about the tipping customs in US and maybe Canada. If they don't know that 15 20 is the norm, they are at least aware that tipping is a huge part of our dining culture. Tourists have several excuses for not tipping: \"Well, they can hear our accent, they probably already know we don't tip in our countries.\" \"They will think we don't know about their tipping customs\" \"It's deceptive, why am I expected pay extra?\" So according to their logic, taxes are deceptive too right? \"It's the employer's job to pay their workers a fair, livable wage. It shouldn't be my job.\" So why are you penalizing the employee for this? It's not the worker's fault he she is getting paid tip minimum. These same people will complain when prices increase as a result of wage hike. \"20 is too much. I'm just gonna decide that xxx is more than enough.\" I've gone out to eat with people from all sorts of cultural backgrounds, and bad tippers often complain about how North American tipping customs are stupid and unnecessary. They then stiff their servers. Sometimes they tell me \"You're tipping too much! Tip this and that amount instead!\" Yeah, they hate tipping so much, they tell ME how much to tip because the standard percentage amount is too much for them. Tourists know that servers rely on tips. I find that tourists in general to be rude and much more demanding, running me ragged for extra this, extra that, complaining that food isn't cooked to their liking, etc. No matter how friendly I am, no matter how great of a service I give them, they stiff me nonetheless. \"Service was great but I won't tip you anyway because I'm sure you would've been less nice if you knew we weren't gonna tip \" I'm not saying ALL tourists are bad. I've served many Germans, Irish, Scandinavians, Brazilians, and Mexicans who tip well. But I definitely find that some ethnicites including a few whose official language is English are completely \"oblivious\". My coworkers often give lectures on how to tip when they find that their foreign guests have stiffed them. Personally I'm not brave enough to do this, and besides it's considered a fireable offence at my workplace and pretty much anywhere else I've worked at . Off the topic but somewhat related, another thing that bothers me is when servers who work at ethnic restaurants tip bad when they go out to eat. Shouldn't they be familiar with tip customs? They are servers themselves. I've read many Yelp reviews about servers at ethnic restaurants going after guests for not tipping enough, or putting service charge on bills even for just one person, even when the menu doesn't mention anything about service charge. This post wasn't meant to be long. But I've worked at many restaurants that were dependent on tourists, I'm just frustrustrated. Thank you for reading.\n\n### Video Caption ###\nThe server states they maintained a friendly attitude and claim to provide great service.

Come to my surprise, when I walk over into the other part of my section, there were two tables sitting there all pissed off! I apologized and let them know what happened, got their drinks and food orders quickly and apologized again. I made sure I was on top of everything they needed, offer complimentary dessert etc etc. \n\nThis is the “funny” part. One table barely said anything, and didn’t really acknowledge my apology so I was like damn okay, I’m not getting a tip from this table. The other table was like “Oh no worries!

Guess who still tipped 20% and who stiffed me? \nI just think it’s funny how people let words portray something completely different than what their money says.

While they recovered well, the initial delay and the miscommunication caused an issue, making the service not perfectly reliable.\n*   **b) Responsiveness:** Score: 5. The server immediately addressed the situation, apologized, and took action to rectify the issue upon realizing the tables were unattended. They quickly took drink and food orders.\n*   **c) Assurance:** Score: 4. The server handled the situation professionally by apologizing and explaining the situation, demonstrating confidence in handling the issue.\n*   **d) Empathy:** Score: 5. The server proactively offered complimentary dessert, showing understanding and going the extra mile to make amends for the earlier lapse in service.\n*   **e) Tangibles:** Score: 4.

They’re really polite and extremely over-the-top nice to me from the get go, except for the dad.

Amazing. The time comes for them to order entrees and the dad orders fish and chips, no modifications.\n\nAbout 20 minutes later I come out with their entrees and the dad asks for an extra tartar sauce for his meal. We do not have tartar sauce and instead the fish and chips come with an aioli(as stated on the menu). I inform him we don’t have tartar sauce and ask if he wants an extra aioli. He flips his shit and yells “what the fuck do you mean you don’t have tartar sauce?! If I knew that I wouldn’t have ordered this!!!” \n\nI ask if he wants any other sauce or if he wants to change his entree(even though it’s his fault for not reading the menu and not even asking in the first place if we had tartar sauce) and he says no. He demands we make tartar sauce for him. I tell him we don’t have the ingredients. He mutters how I’ve ruined his dinner and the rest of the family is silent. He chooses to keep his food so whatever, I walk away and let them eat. \n\nAfter about 10 minutes he says he’s done and has me take away his food he barely touched. I noticed that he leaves the table and doesn’t come back at all. The wife informs me they’re ready for the check so I bring it to them. I’m processing her card and she asks if she can say a few words. I say yeah is everything okay? She says: “hey I just wanted to thank you for taking care of us you were amazing, and I’m so sorry that rude people give you shit for things that are out of control. I hope you have an amazing night, you were great”. I realize she was PISSED at her husband and she must’ve said something to him. She proceeds to tip me 25% and leave. It felt really good to have some sort of apology when I thought they would’ve sided with him.",

    "text_content": "Hi there!\n\nI'm visiting the USA for the first time, and there's a thing I don't get about tipping. Not the concept of tipping, but the *mechanics*.\n\nHere's what happened: we went to a restaurant, we had good food, our waiter was nice (not used to the \"extremely close and friendly\" style, but that's just culture shock). When he brought us the bill, I gave him my credit card, he went to process the payment and charged the exact amount the meal cost.\n\nWhen he came back with the card we asked him \"excuse us, we're from Europe, we don't know how tipping works\". He explained the concept of \"you usually tip between 18 and 22 percent, and this money goes to the waiter\". Okay, we wrote the amount corresponding to 20% in the \"Tip\" section of the bill, and sat there waiting for him to take it. After 10 minutes he came and asked \"is anything the matter?\" and we said \"yeah, aren't you going to charge for the tip?\". He explained that we just write the amount, sign, and they charge the credit card that we payed with. We felt a bit stupid, he apologised for making us wait (not really his fault, but well, that made us feel a bit better I guess) and we left.\n\nI've been checking my credit card moves and they haven't charged for the tip. I have two questions: first, is that how tipping works in every restaurant? We don't want to make a fool of ourselves again. And secondly, did we do something wrong? Any idea why I can't see the payment? This was for breakfast, about 20 hours ago.\n\nThanks for taking the time to read my question! And double thanks if you answer.\n\nEdit: thanks to everyone who answered! After a couple of days, as many of you explained, the amount charged to my card got updated.",

I'm visiting the USA for the first time, and there's a thing I don't get about tipping. Not the concept of tipping, but the mechanics . Here's what happened: we went to a restaurant, we had good food, our waiter was nice not used to the \"extremely close and friendly\" style, but that's just culture shock . When he brought us the bill, I gave him my credit card, he went to process the payment and charged the exact amount the meal cost. When he came back with the card we asked him \"excuse us, we're from Europe, we don't know how tipping works\". He explained the concept of \"you usually tip between 18 and 22 percent, and this money goes to the waiter\". Okay, we wrote the amount corresponding to 20 in the \"Tip\" section of the bill, and sat there waiting for him to take it. After 10 minutes he came and asked \"is anything the matter?\" and we said \"yeah, aren't you going to charge for the tip?\". He explained that we just write the amount, sign, and they charge the credit card that we payed with. We felt a bit stupid, he apologised for making us wait not really his fault, but well, that made us feel a bit better I guess and we left. I've been checking my credit card moves and they haven't charged for the tip. I have two questions: first, is that how tipping works in every restaurant? We don't want to make a fool of ourselves again. And secondly, did we do something wrong? Any idea why I can't see the payment? This was for breakfast, about 20 hours ago. Thanks for taking the time to read my question! And double thanks if you answer. Edit: thanks to everyone who answered! After a couple of days, as many of you explained, the amount charged to my card got updated.\n\n### Video Caption ###\nThe server was described as nice and having an \"extremely close and friendly\" style. He accurately processed the initial bill payment. When asked about [REMOVED] mechanics, he clearly explained the standard procedure. After a delay, he checked on the table and apologized for the wait.\n\n### User Input ###\n    1. Country: USA, Type: Casual dining\n    2. Restaurant name: Gold Spoon\n    3.

Given the positive feedback about the food, and the server being \"nice\", I'll choose the higher end of the range, i.e., 20%.\n    *   **Ethical Considerations:** No ethical issues were identified.\n    *   **Tip Amount:** 20% of $25.00 = $5.00\n    *   **Total Bill:** $25.00 + $5.00 = $30.00\n\n###Output indicator###\n```json\n{\n  \"### Video Caption i(th) ###\": \"The server was described as nice and having an \\\"extremely close and friendly\\\" style.

    "text_content": "EDIT: Why are we talking about tips? I never brought up tips but y'all keep bringing it up. Tips have nothing to do with this story. \n\nEDIT #2: These guys weren't there very long. Two hours max. I'm not sure why people are assuming that they were there all day. So, six drinks in the span of two hours without any food or water would get everyone fucked up. \nMaybe it's the wording of \"lunch server\"? Lunch is served from 11am until 5pm. \n\nThis'll be short.\n\nI inherited a two top from the lunch server when dinner service started at 530. Two European dudes. They had only been drinking and the lunch server said that they were drunk and the guy in seat one asked if she'd go home with him. (She's a lesbian but it's cute that you think you have a chance.)\n\nI check their bill and they've already racked up $200 with just cocktails. They started drinking doubles, so there were a lot of drinks on the bill. My restaurant makes us order two drinks, modify DOUBLE on one and DON'T MAKE on the other, for each double. Your $15 cocktail is now $30. Good job. \n\nI check on them, introduce myself, and see if they need anything else. Their doubles are half full. They ask for a dinner menu and I drop it off. \n\nA few minutes later, I see them asking one of my bussers a question. I head over and the guy in seat one asks me about one of our menu items. We list which farms supplied us with certain items on the menu and he thought the name was hilarious. Whatever. \n\nThen he asked for another round. I told them that they'd need to drink some water before I serve them again. They denied that, saying that they were Danish and Danes don't drink water. Fine. I explained that they already had six drinks each, which they also denied. I showed them the bill, explaining how we charge for doubles. They denied ever having doubles even though they were drinking out of pints. Our standard pours are never in pints. \n\nI found a manager and explained what happened. They told them what I told them, and they were upset that we were kicking them out. We never kicked them out. Just told them to order some water and maybe bread. \n\nThey left $213 on a $215 bill. \n\nThanks, assholes. Thankfully I'm not responsible for the two dollars.",

I never brought up tips but y'all keep bringing it up. Tips have nothing to do with this story. EDIT 2: These guys weren't there very long. Two hours max. I'm not sure why people are assuming that they were there all day. So, six drinks in the span of two hours without any food or water would get everyone fucked up. Maybe it's the wording of \"lunch server\"? Lunch is served from 11am until 5pm. This'll be short. I inherited a two top from the lunch server when dinner service started at 530. Two European dudes. They had only been drinking and the lunch server said that they were drunk and the guy in seat one asked if she'd go home with him. She's a lesbian but it's cute that you think you have a chance. I check their bill and they've already racked up 200 with just cocktails. They started drinking doubles, so there were a lot of drinks on the bill. My restaurant makes us order two drinks, modify DOUBLE on one and DON'T MAKE on the other, for each double. Your 15 cocktail is now 30. Good job. I check on them, introduce myself, and see if they need anything else. Their doubles are half full. They ask for a dinner menu and I drop it off. A few minutes later, I see them asking one of my bussers a question. I head over and the guy in seat one asks me about one of our menu items. We list which farms supplied us with certain items on the menu and he thought the name was hilarious. Whatever. Then he asked for another round. I told them that they'd need to drink some water before I serve them again. They denied that, saying that they were Danish and Danes don't drink water. Fine. I explained that they already had six drinks each, which they also denied. I showed them the bill, explaining how we charge for doubles. They denied ever having doubles even though they were drinking out of pints. Our standard pours are never in pints. I found a manager and explained what happened. They told them what I told them, and they were upset that we were kicking them out. We never kicked them out. Just told them to order some water and maybe bread. They left 213 on a 215 bill. Thanks, assholes. Thankfully I'm not responsible for the two dollars.\n\n### Video Caption ###\nThe server inherited the table, checked the bill, introduced themselves, and checked in on the customers. They responded to a customer query originating via a busser, answering a menu question. The server declined further alcohol service, citing customer consumption, requesting water be ordered, showing the bill, and explaining the double drink policy when customers disputed their order. The server escalated the situation by involving a manager.\n\n### User Input ###\n    1. Country: USA, Type: Casual dining\n    2. Restaurant name: Gold Spoon\n    3. Calculated subtotal: $25.00\n",

Video Evaluation Criteria and Scoring**\n\nThe video provides a clear account of the server's interactions with the customers. Here's the breakdown:\n\n*   **a) Reliability: 3** - The server correctly identified the customers' level of intoxication and their excessive alcohol consumption. The server provided accurate information about the drink orders. However, the server was not in control of the original order, and there were issues with the customer orders initially, but the server addressed the situation effectively.\n    *Reason: The server had to deal with a situation she didn't start, but she was able to address it using information and was very clear about what the customers had been doing. The server showed the bill and was able to explain the ordering.\n*   **b) Responsiveness: 5** - The server was very responsive, immediately taking over the table and introducing herself. She answered questions, responded to requests, and handled the situation professionally and quickly.\n    *Reason: The server efficiently addressed the customer needs and queries, including addressing the menu and asking if they needed anything else.\n*   **c) Assurance: 5** - The server confidently handled the situation, explaining the restaurant's policies about doubles and alcohol service limits. She also involved the manager when necessary.\n    *Reason: The server clearly understood the restaurant's policies and communicated them confidently to the customers. She didn't back down when the customers tried to argue and immediately found the manager to help.\n*   **d) Empathy: 3** - The server displayed professionalism rather than empathy. The situation made it difficult for her to be empathetic, as the customer was not in a proper condition to be served. While she had to deal with an unfriendly situation, the server maintained a degree of respect.\n    *Reason: The server was professional and firm, which in this case was the correct approach to protect the restaurant and its policy.\n*   **e) Tangibles: 5** - There's no information about the physical appearance of the table or uniform in the provided text. However, the server's professionalism suggests the restaurant maintains cleanliness.\n    *Reason: This is inferred from the text about the server.\n\n**1-2.

    "text_content": "I’m training to serve at a new restaurant and was on my second day of training with a server. We will call her A. She had a good amount of reservations and I was excited to finally see the restaurant busy because the day before it was insanely slow. Anyways, she gets sat with a 6 top and I’m shadowing her then she gets sat with a 2 top and asks if I wanna give it a shot! I don’t know the menu very well but it’s our brunch menu so I go for it. It goes super well and their tab came out to be 40$ and they left me a 15$ tip. great! After, She gets sat with a 6 top, and another 2 top and asks me to take the 2. Sure no problem! It goes super well, their tab was 50$ and they left me a 26$ tip which was a huge confidence boost and I was feeling really good.\nNow this is where I get confused. She gets sat with an 11 top of some older ladies and another 5 top and I’m shadowing her and helping her get drinks, then her next reservation of 9 people comes really early. She’s in the weeds and asks if I can greet the 9 top and take their drink order. Sure! So I do that and then she ends up asking if I can just take the whole tables order and she will help with any questions I may have. I oblige and do that, and do it well. I think I forgot to add cheese on one persons eggs. I tell them they’re my 3rd table and thank them for being so patient and they told me I’m doing a really good job, overall they were super sweet. I close them out and they’re on their way. So they end up leaving and I start bussing the table and I peak at the tab. 240$ and they left “me” 60$. Which is a very nice tip and I’m happy about it ( even though I know I’m not getting it because I’m training. I leave it on the table and a couple minutes go by and I notice the tab is gone so I catch A and ask her just out of curiosity, how did I do on that table? Was the tip alright? She looks at me and says, “ yeah you did okay! It was about 35$!” \n\nWhy did she lie? I don’t understand. I told my mom and a close friend and they think it’s because she didn’t want to share the money, which I wasn’t expecting but why would she want me to think I did worse than I actually did? It hurt my feelings because I really felt nervous about taking a big table so soon but I wanted to help her out because she has been so sweet and I even considered being friends with her. Does anyone have any clue why she’d lie to me? :(  anytime I have trained a server in the past if they took a table and did everything for them I’d atleast give them half of the tip. I’m just at a loss. Now I feel like I can’t trust this person. Any advice or insight would be appreciated! \n",

We will call her A. She had a good amount of reservations and I was excited to finally see the restaurant busy because the day before it was insanely slow. Anyways, she gets sat with a 6 top and I m shadowing her then she gets sat with a 2 top and asks if I wanna give it a shot! I don t know the menu very well but it s our brunch menu so I go for it. It goes super well and their tab came out to be 40 and they left me a 15 tip. great! After, She gets sat with a 6 top, and another 2 top and asks me to take the 2. Sure no problem! It goes super well, their tab was 50 and they left me a 26 tip which was a huge confidence boost and I was feeling really good. Now this is where I get confused. She gets sat with an 11 top of some older ladies and another 5 top and I m shadowing her and helping her get drinks, then her next reservation of 9 people comes really early. She s in the weeds and asks if I can greet the 9 top and take their drink order. Sure! So I do that and then she ends up asking if I can just take the whole tables order and she will help with any questions I may have. I oblige and do that, and do it well. I think I forgot to add cheese on one persons eggs. I tell them they re my 3rd table and thank them for being so patient and they told me I m doing a really good job, overall they were super sweet. I close them out and they re on their way. So they end up leaving and I start bussing the table and I peak at the tab. 240 and they left me 60 . Which is a very nice tip and I m happy about it even though I know I m not getting it because I m training. I leave it on the table and a couple minutes go by and I notice the tab is gone so I catch A and ask her just out of curiosity, how did I do on that table? Was the tip alright? She looks at me and says, yeah you did okay! It was about 35 ! Why did she lie? I don t understand. I told my mom and a close friend and they think it s because she didn t want to share the money, which I wasn t expecting but why would she want me to think I did worse than I actually did? It hurt my feelings because I really felt nervous about taking a big table so soon but I wanted to help her out because she has been so sweet and I even considered being friends with her. Does anyone have any clue why she d lie to me? : anytime I have trained a server in the past if they took a table and did everything for them I d atleast give them half of the tip. I m just at a loss. Now I feel like I can t trust this person. Any advice or insight would be appreciated!\n\n### Video Caption ###\nA trainee server successfully managed two smaller tables and later handled a 9-top party, taking drink and food orders. The server communicated they were a trainee and thanked the large party for their patience, with a potential minor error forgetting cheese on one dish.\n\n### User Input ###\n    1. Country: USA, Type: Casual dining\n    2. Restaurant name: Gold Spoon\n    3. Calculated subtotal: $25.00\n",
    "response": "Okay, I will analyze the provided information to determine the appropriate tip.\n\n### Analysis of the Video Caption\nThe video caption describes a trainee server's experience. Here's a breakdown:\n\n*   **Positive Aspects:** The trainee successfully handled multiple tables, including a large party of 9. They were proactive in taking orders and communicating their trainee status. They demonstrated good customer service by thanking the customers for their patience.\n*   **Areas for Improvement:** A minor mistake was made (potentially forgetting cheese).\n*   **Overall:** The trainee showed potential and effort.\n\n**1-1. Video Evaluation Criteria**\n\nHere's the scoring for the video evaluation criteria, with justifications:\n\n*   **a) Reliability: 3** Mostly accurate orders, occasional lack of confirmation. The trainee handled orders effectively, but there was a potential mistake regarding the cheese on the dish. While a single minor mistake is noted, the trainee managed a complex order successfully overall.\n*   **b) Responsiveness: 4** Quick and polite responses. The trainee was responsive, taking the initiative in taking orders. The video does not explicitly show the trainee's response to customer questions.\n*   **c) Assurance: 4** Professional explanations, confident handling. The trainee, although inexperienced, approached the tables with confidence and took on the task of ordering. They communicated and made the customers comfortable.\n*   **d) Empathy: 4** Remembers customer preferences, offers personalized services like birthday events. The trainee recognized the fact that they were trainees and worked with patience.\n*   **e) Tangibles: 5** Meets FDA Food Code standards, ServSafe certification level cleanliness. There's no information about the tangibles. Assuming the restaurant has good standard and cleanliness, assign a 5.\n\n**1-2. Video Score Calculation**\n\nVideo Score = (3 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 5) * 4 = 80\n\n**5. Total Score**\n\n*   **5-1. Total Score Calculation**\n    Total Score = 80\n\n**6. Tip Calculation**\n\n*   **6-1. Calculate the tip based on the total score and analysis.**\n    *   The restaurant is in the USA, and it's a casual dining establishment.\n    *   The total score is 80, which falls within the \"Good\" service range (16 to 20) according to the guidelines provided.\n    *   Considering the \"Good\" service level, a tip percentage between 16% and 20% is appropriate.\n    *   Since the trainee was overall successful, despite the minor mistake, and the customer service was excellent, I'll choose a higher tip percentage.\n    *   The subtotal is $25.00.\n\n*   **6-2. Format**\n\n###Output indicator###\n```json\n{\n  \"### Video Caption i(th) ###\": \"The trainee server took orders effectively and thanked the customers for their patience, with a potential minor error forgetting cheese on one dish.\",\n  \"Final Reason\": \"The trainee provided good service despite a minor mistake. Based on the USA casual dining standards, a 'Good' service level results in a 18% tip, which is the upper value due to the fact that the trainee did not fail with the large tables.\",\n  \"final_tip_percentage\": 18,\n  \"final_tip_amount\": 4.50,\n  \"final_total_bill\": 29.50\n}\n```",

    "title": "14 Top Walk in Weekly Regulars. Every Sunday. 45 minutes before closing. (Long story)",
    "text_content": "To start, I will say I was pretty happy to be working. I've been hustling up shifts left and right.\n\nI was scheduled for a patio shift that night (Sunday). But, I had a feeling I'd get called off since it was overcast that day. Well, I got a call after leaving the gym and answered to the voice of my manager asking me to come in an hour early. Woo!\n\nOne of the veteran servers volunteered to stay home since it looked less busy than expected that day, but since it picked up they decided to reschedule the section and just put me there instead. Totally fine. I'm always willing to work.\n\nSundays are steady. Mostly after church families. We don't get a lot of Sunday Funday types. We are surrounded by locally owned eateries that take up all that business and we are a corporate chain. Fine by me. I worked at one of the smaller ones for a while under the owner from hell. I'm kind of weird and appreciate the structure and organization a lot of corporate companies have. It's always been a more comfortable environment for me and I could never understand why.\n\nBack to the story. I'm supposed to get phased out pretty early because I'm also supposed to break the closer that night. Hostess walks up and tells me I'm done and hat the manager said to break the closer. So, I head over and the closer looks at me and says, \"How about I break you? I don't feel lime closing and I know you want to work.\" Deal.\n\nWe inform the manager and get to it. My manager pulls me aside and tells me that for the past few weeks a 10 top has been coming in late. They are a theatre group of sorts, older. They all want split checks and order lots of booze and stay late. He said they aren't the best tippers, but they tip around 15%. I shrug and figure it can't be that bad.\n\nFast forward to 10:15PM. We close at 11 on Sundays. The backwaiter has started to clean to line and dumped out most of the rice and keep the rest in a warm tray. I tell him to wait just in case, he said it was plenty of rice and it would be fine. I shrug it off. He usually does a good job so I'm fine with his decision.\n\nThey walk in. The hostesses have all been cut. So my manager and the other closer who is finishing her sidework set up the party. I have 5 other tables at this point. 1 has the check dropped. 1 is on dessert. 1 is closed and hanging out. 2 are finishing up apps and I've just fired their entrees in the kitchen. I go up to them and swap out their dirty things for fresh plates, grab refills, and let them know I'm about to go MIA and nod over to the new party. They laugh and understand. *phew*\n\nI turn around and the back waiter has already brought out a big tray of water. Usually this is a big no-no unless the water is ordered, but it depends on who is managing. The manager at the time wanted to keep them occupied until I could get over there to start drinks. So, waters it was. He's a new transfer from a store that closed down and i couldn't be happier. He's level headed, funny, and encouraging. I had a bit of a rough run the night before and every time i messed up i went to him and he just told me shit happens and to keep busting my ass as i always do and that I'm doing solid work.\n\nBefore i can even get past the big table to grab a couple last things for my tables who I'm about to go MIA on, i get waved down and orders are getting thrown at me without so much as me being able to say, \"I'll be with you in one moment, my friends.\" Off we go.\n\nMultiple people inform me to split the check, one reminds me of the Moscow Mule she had last week that didn't have enough ginger. She asks if i remember. I didn't even close that week. I tell her no but i inform her that I'm on it.\n\nWell, we've all had trickle-in parties. They didn't do that. They arrived together. 14 of them. But they all ordered at different times. I made a good 5 different runs to the bar for the first round alone. I've got a lot of energy and have had a good night, so I'm okay at this point. My manager is checking on my other tables for me. Every time I try to escape, they wave me down and want more. Luckily, the other tables all understood and even left pretty good tips.\n\nNow, drinks are all on the table and I've already started taking orders for round 2. The other closer decided to stick around for a bit until the group settled in. She's been getting me refills on water and non-alcoholic drinks.\n\nI work with mostly amazing people who always look out for each other. The vets help me out a lot because they know I want to work and I'm always their go to guy if they want a night off. In return, they always have my back in tight situations. My managers (mostly) love that shifts and hours make me more giddy than a kid in a candy store. They also have my back.\n\nI finish off bringing the 2nd round and someone asks when I'm going to start taking food orders with some snark. I smile (genuinely, because the further along we move, the closer I get to getting them out - it is 10:30 at this point) and bust out my book and pen.\n\nEach order. EACH order of food. All 13 of them (1 person was just drinking) had a modifier. Often times a mod that I could only type in. There was on specific Asian lady who liked to snap and point at me who's food was modified quite a bit.\n\nI manage to take all food orders in one round, match them all to the drinks according to seat numbers in Aloha, get them fired off at the same time, and not have any voids due to my own faults. I had one void of a change in order because she didn't enjoy her food and sent it back (aka dinner for the back waiter and me).\n\nAt this point, I head back and start clearing empty glasses and getting another round of alcohol. Shortly after, entrees hit the table and they start eating.  I go off to bus my other tables who have now gone. Every time I try... They call my name and want more stuff.\n\nIt is now 10:45. We are supposed to close in 15 minutes. Faces in the kitchen are grim. Though, finally, the party has settled for a bit and I can munch a little in the back.\n\nAfter a minute or two I head back out and people start asking for boxes. I grab a bunch and start boxing food. The box requests have also come in the trickle-in format. I make multiple box runs.\n\nAt this point I've become gassed. I was running circles for the party. I went into fuck it mode and figured I'd clean the other tables altogether after they leave.\n\nAs I box food I hear someone mention fortune cookies. Before I can say anything I look up and Ms. Snap-Her-Fingers Asian lady is grabbing cookies from the server station.\n\nTHERE IS NOTHING THAT ANNOYS ME MORE. That is a station for WORK. Get the fuck out of there!\n\nNow everyone has cookies. Whatever. It's 11:15. Two people flag me down and want to-go food. The kitchen is already halfway shut down. They have to reopen a few things and cook. Groans are heard (can't blame them). I finally get the last orders out and the food boxed.\n\nThey ask for the checks. I print them out all 1-by-1, put them in books, and send them out. Trickle-in payments. 1 here\n 3 there. 1 here. 1 there. 7 there, etc.\n\nSlowly but surely, I get them all closed out. They even swarmed a bit because they were \"in a hurry.\" which obviously doesn't explain why they were all there still at 12:15.\n\nFINALLY. At 12:20, they trickle out. The cleaning crew is already there and working. I plop down for a bit to breath. I close all the checks, adjust the tip entries, and run my check out so he can get into the office and start closing down the system. At this point, the dishwashers have already turned off and cleaned the washer for the night. I had to leave 4 bus tubs full of glassware and plateware for the morning crew.\n\nThe cleaning crew help me reset the dining room and wipe down the tables. Finally, I settle into the back and finish up closing sidework. Marry glass racks, break down soda machines, pull fresh glassware to the Bev stations, etc. I burn the ice, wipe down the line and FINALLY clock out at 12:50am. Just 9 minutes before I hit over time. The cleaning crew and kitchen were already long gone. I take the elevator to the basement (too tired at this point to want to deal with stairs) and head to the office to hand in my clock out. My manager was surprised I was still willing to be so thorough with closing work and that he's almost never seem a server in the building after cleaning crew leaves.\n\nHe asked how they tipped. I shrugged and said exactly how he told me they would. Not bad, but not great. He laughed and told me if it made me feel any better I managed to accrue 33 hours this week (CA servers get state min. wage so hourly is a nice addition to tips). It was a good feeling when so many others are complaining about not working enough (yet, not piping up to mgmt or asking others for shifts).\n\nHe thanked me, told me to enjoy my day off, and I headed back up. I got on my bike and did my usual 9 block cruise home, dodging club rats and bar hoppers half the way.\n\nWhat a shift. What crazy people. Probably gonna do it again next week",

I've been hustling up shifts left and right. I was scheduled for a patio shift that night Sunday . But, I had a feeling I'd get called off since it was overcast that day. Well, I got a call after leaving the gym and answered to the voice of my manager asking me to come in an hour early. Woo! One of the veteran servers volunteered to stay home since it looked less busy than expected that day, but since it picked up they decided to reschedule the section and just put me there instead. Totally fine. I'm always willing to work. Sundays are steady. Mostly after church families. We don't get a lot of Sunday Funday types. We are surrounded by locally owned eateries that take up all that business and we are a corporate chain. Fine by me. I worked at one of the smaller ones for a while under the owner from hell. I'm kind of weird and appreciate the structure and organization a lot of corporate companies have. It's always been a more comfortable environment for me and I could never understand why. Back to the story. I'm supposed to get phased out pretty early because I'm also supposed to break the closer that night. Hostess walks up and tells me I'm done and hat the manager said to break the closer. So, I head over and the closer looks at me and says, \"How about I break you? I don't feel lime closing and I know you want to work.\" Deal. We inform the manager and get to it. My manager pulls me aside and tells me that for the past few weeks a 10 top has been coming in late. They are a theatre group of sorts, older. They all want split checks and order lots of booze and stay late. He said they aren't the best tippers, but they tip around 15 . I shrug and figure it can't be that bad. Fast forward to 10:15PM. We close at 11 on Sundays. The backwaiter has started to clean to line and dumped out most of the rice and keep the rest in a warm tray. I tell him to wait just in case, he said it was plenty of rice and it would be fine. I shrug it off. He usually does a good job so I'm fine with his decision. They walk in. The hostesses have all been cut. So my manager and the other closer who is finishing her sidework set up the party. I have 5 other tables at this point. 1 has the check dropped. 1 is on dessert. 1 is closed and hanging out. 2 are finishing up apps and I've just fired their entrees in the kitchen. I go up to them and swap out their dirty things for fresh plates, grab refills, and let them know I'm about to go MIA and nod over to the new party. They laugh and understand. phew I turn around and the back waiter has already brought out a big tray of water. Usually this is a big no no unless the water is ordered, but it depends on who is managing. The manager at the time wanted to keep them occupied until I could get over there to start drinks. So, waters it was. He's a new transfer from a store that closed down and i couldn't be happier. He's level headed, funny, and encouraging. I had a bit of a rough run the night before and every time i messed up i went to him and he just told me shit happens and to keep busting my ass as i always do and that I'm doing solid work. Before i can even get past the big table to grab a couple last things for my tables who I'm about to go MIA on, i get waved down and orders are getting thrown at me without so much as me being able to say, \"I'll be with you in one moment, my friends.\" Off we go. Multiple people inform me to split the check, one reminds me of the Moscow Mule she had last week that didn't have enough ginger. She asks if i remember. I didn't even close that week. I tell her no but i inform her that I'm on it. Well, we've all had trickle in parties. They didn't do that. They arrived together. 14 of them. But they all ordered at different times. I made a good 5 different runs to the bar for the first round alone. I've got a lot of energy and have had a good night, so I'm okay at this point. My manager is checking on my other tables for me. Every time I try to escape, they wave me down and want more. Luckily, the other tables all understood and even left pretty good tips. Now, drinks are all on the table and I've already started taking orders for round 2. The other closer decided to stick around for a bit until the group settled in. She's been getting me refills on water and non alcoholic drinks. I work with mostly amazing people who always look out for each other. The vets help me out a lot because they know I want to work and I'm always their go to guy if they want a night off. In return, they always have my back in tight situations. My managers mostly love that shifts and hours make me more giddy than a kid in a candy store. They also have my back. I finish off bringing the 2nd round and someone asks when I'm going to start taking food orders with some snark. I smile genuinely, because the further along we move, the closer I get to getting them out it is 10:30 at this point and bust out my book and pen. Each order. EACH order of food. All 13 of them 1 person was just drinking had a modifier. Often times a mod that I could only type in. There was on specific Asian lady who liked to snap and point at me who's food was modified quite a bit. I manage to take all food orders in one round, match them all to the drinks according to seat numbers in Aloha, get them fired off at the same time, and not have any voids due to my own faults. I had one void of a change in order because she didn't enjoy her food and sent it back aka dinner for the back waiter and me . At this point, I head back and start clearing empty glasses and getting another round of alcohol. Shortly after, entrees hit the table and they start eating. I go off to bus my other tables who have now gone. Every time I try... They call my name and want more stuff. It is now 10:45. We are supposed to close in 15 minutes. Faces in the kitchen are grim. Though, finally, the party has settled for a bit and I can munch a little in the back. After a minute or two I head back out and people start asking for boxes. I grab a bunch and start boxing food. The box requests have also come in the trickle in format. I make multiple box runs. At this point I've become gassed. I was running circles for the party. I went into fuck it mode and figured I'd clean the other tables altogether after they leave. As I box food I hear someone mention fortune cookies. Before I can say anything I look up and Ms. Snap Her Fingers Asian lady is grabbing cookies from the server station. THERE IS NOTHING THAT ANNOYS ME MORE. That is a station for WORK. Get the fuck out of there! Now everyone has cookies. Whatever. It's 11:15. Two people flag me down and want to go food. The kitchen is already halfway shut down. They have to reopen a few things and cook. Groans are heard can't blame them . I finally get the last orders out and the food boxed. They ask for the checks. I print them out all 1 by 1, put them in books, and send them out. Trickle in payments. 1 here 3 there. 1 here. 1 there. 7 there, etc. Slowly but surely, I get them all closed out. They even swarmed a bit because they were \"in a hurry.\" which obviously doesn't explain why they were all there still at 12:15. FINALLY. At 12:20, they trickle out. The cleaning crew is already there and working. I plop down for a bit to breath. I close all the checks, adjust the tip entries, and run my check out so he can get into the office and start closing down the system. At this point, the dishwashers have already turned off and cleaned the washer for the night. I had to leave 4 bus tubs full of glassware and plateware for the morning crew. The cleaning crew help me reset the dining room and wipe down the tables. Finally, I settle into the back and finish up closing sidework. Marry glass racks, break down soda machines, pull fresh glassware to the Bev stations, etc. I burn the ice, wipe down the line and FINALLY clock out at 12:50am. Just 9 minutes before I hit over time. The cleaning crew and kitchen were already long gone. I take the elevator to the basement too tired at this point to want to deal with stairs and head to the office to hand in my clock out. My manager was surprised I was still willing to be so thorough with closing work and that he's almost never seem a server in the building after cleaning crew leaves. He asked how they tipped. I shrugged and said exactly how he told me they would. Not bad, but not great. He laughed and told me if it made me feel any better I managed to accrue 33 hours this week CA servers get state min. wage so hourly is a nice addition to tips . It was a good feeling when so many others are complaining about not working enough yet, not piping up to mgmt or asking others for shifts . He thanked me, told me to enjoy my day off, and I headed back up. I got on my bike and did my usual 9 block cruise home, dodging club rats and bar hoppers half the way. What a shift. What crazy people. Probably gonna do it again next week\n\n### Video Caption ###\nThe server efficiently managed a large party (14 people) with complex, individual orders, split checks, and scattered requests, handling multiple drink rounds and accurately taking 13 food orders with modifiers without personal error voids.

    "response": "### Analysis of the Reddit Post and Tip Calculation ###\n\n**1-1. Video Evaluation Criteria**\n\n*   **a) Reliability:** 4 - The server took 13 complex food orders with modifiers, all of which were accurate, as the post mentions no errors in order taking by the server himself. There was only one void, which was due to the customer's dissatisfaction. They were able to match orders to drinks and seat numbers and managed to not have any voids due to his own faults.\n    *   *Justification:* The server handled a large, complex order with accuracy and efficiency despite the challenging circumstances (individual orders, modifiers, split checks).\n*   **b) Responsiveness:** 5 - The server responded to numerous requests, multiple drink rounds, and constant demands from the party. The post highlights how the server remained responsive and continued working, even when he was clearly exhausted. He also maintained a positive and helpful attitude, even when rushed and dealing with many requests at once.\n    *   *Justification:* The server showed exceptional responsiveness by handling a demanding group and their constant needs, consistently working to accommodate them, including multiple drink rounds and food orders.\n*   **c) Assurance:** 4 - The server maintained a professional attitude. The server showed confidence and patience when taking orders, even from demanding customers.\n    *   *Justification:* Although the post doesn't detail specific interactions to showcase the server's explanations of menu items or wine pairings, the server's consistent professionalism and ability to handle a large party with complex orders demonstrate confidence and ability.\n*   **d) Empathy:** 3 - While the server was working under significant pressure, the post doesn't explicitly state the server was able to show much empathy to the customer, but neither does it mention the server being rude or dismissive. The server's positive attitude and willingness to work were noted by the manager.\n    *   *Justification:* The server was focused on efficiency and managing the large party, which limited the ability to personalize the service. However, the overall positive attitude and willingness to handle the situation show some degree of empathy.\n*   **e) Tangibles:** 4 - The post does not describe a dirty environment, which suggests the environment was clean. The server was busy and focused on service.\n    *   *Justification:* The post does not mention the state of cleanliness in the restaurant, but the fact that the server was able to focus on working while managing a large party suggests the environment was tidy.\n\n**1-2.

    "text_content": "I’ll to keep this as brief as possible. Happened last night and wow. \n\n4 pm, me, going to coffee shop a block away from my job to get a cup before my shift. Start chatting it up with the cute cashier. She asks me where I work, I introduce myself and say restaurant right around the corner, she goes “oh awesome! I’m grabbing drinks there with a friend later. Little friend date. This extra shot’s on me :)” \n\nSo I was like cool, little flirt flirt. Hope to see her later at work, maybe chat it up more.\n\nSo fast forward, it’s a slow slow night, snowy and rainy outside, but we still get a happy hour pop. Within 15 minutes back-to-back I have 5 tables sat. Nbd. One of them is this guy, by himself, but the host told me he’s waiting for someone. I offer to get him a drink while he waits, he orders a drink and an app. Says to me “yeah man just waiting on my girlfriend she should be here shortly.” \n\nGuess who shows up 15 minutes later? Coffee girl. At the table. With this guy. Her “boyfriend.” \n\nI’m like oh, guess I misread the flirt. Things happen. But then I remember she did explicitly say friend date. I go over to greet her and she goes “FramingHips, right? I thought I remembered your name.” \n\nThe guy gets defensive and is like, “oh you guys seem pretty friendly...?” \n\nShe then points to the guy and goes “this is my *friend,* I met FramingHips today and told him we were having a little *friend* date.”\n\nWell, I saw the blood drain from this dude’s face. I’m thinking oh god, this dude thinks he’s on a date and she just friend-zoned him in front of me, and I’m “the other guy” to him and I don’t even know this girl. And now I have to serve them. \n\nWell, after that, rather than being a machismo bro, this guy started being really buddy-buddy with me, talking about how great of a job I was doing, how great of a tipper he is, yadda yadda. I’m like I get it dude, you’re trying to save face. \n\nAfter awhile we all get more comfortable, and the awkwardness sort of dissipates between jokes. Then they call me over to ask me a question about polyamory versus monogamy, and if I’d ever had a threesome. \n\nI’m a pretty wild and crazy guy so I humor them and open up a bit. It’s a slow night, all the guests are happy, paid, or both, so I can spend some time chatting. We get a nice rapport going, I learn to dude is bi, oh that’s cool, and I’m like alright where is this night going...? Am I going to have a threesome later?\n\nCutting through the awkwardness, I end up kind of becoming friends with this guy, in a weird way, and sort of lose any interest in the girl completely. The more I talked with her I was like oh alright, she’s kind of a bitch. Golden rule kinda thing, would I even want to be with a girl who shut down our date in front of a stranger? This guy though, he’s funny and nice, good looking, seems like he’d be a pal. \n\nSo at the end of their night she goes to the bathroom and I start chatting it up with this guy about how embarrassing the whole situation seemed in the beginning. Guy is super cool, he’s like “yeah man turns out she has a boyfriend anyway, jokes on us, but I live up the street if you wanna grab a beer sometime.” He tipped 25%.\n\nFunny thing is they friended me on Facebook after. \n\nEDIT: he just passed my job and ducked in with his buddy to say hey and we made a beer date haha ",

Happened last night and wow. 4 pm, me, going to coffee shop a block away from my job to get a cup before my shift. Start chatting it up with the cute cashier. She asks me where I work, I introduce myself and say restaurant right around the corner, she goes oh awesome! I m grabbing drinks there with a friend later. Little friend date. This extra shot s on me : So I was like cool, little flirt flirt. Hope to see her later at work, maybe chat it up more. So fast forward, it s a slow slow night, snowy and rainy outside, but we still get a happy hour pop. Within 15 minutes back to back I have 5 tables sat. Nbd. One of them is this guy, by himself, but the host told me he s waiting for someone. I offer to get him a drink while he waits, he orders a drink and an app. Says to me yeah man just waiting on my girlfriend she should be here shortly. Guess who shows up 15 minutes later? Coffee girl. At the table. With this guy. Her boyfriend. I m like oh, guess I misread the flirt. Things happen. But then I remember she did explicitly say friend date. I go over to greet her and she goes FramingHips, right? I thought I remembered your name. The guy gets defensive and is like, oh you guys seem pretty friendly...? She then points to the guy and goes this is my friend, I met FramingHips today and told him we were having a little friend date. Well, I saw the blood drain from this dude s face. I m thinking oh god, this dude thinks he s on a date and she just friend zoned him in front of me, and I m the other guy to him and I don t even know this girl. And now I have to serve them. Well, after that, rather than being a machismo bro, this guy started being really buddy buddy with me, talking about how great of a job I was doing, how great of a tipper he is, yadda yadda. I m like I get it dude, you re trying to save face. After awhile we all get more comfortable, and the awkwardness sort of dissipates between jokes. Then they call me over to ask me a question about polyamory versus monogamy, and if I d ever had a threesome. I m a pretty wild and crazy guy so I humor them and open up a bit. It s a slow night, all the guests are happy, paid, or both, so I can spend some time chatting. We get a nice rapport going, I learn to dude is bi, oh that s cool, and I m like alright where is this night going...? Am I going to have a threesome later? Cutting through the awkwardness, I end up kind of becoming friends with this guy, in a weird way, and sort of lose any interest in the girl completely. The more I talked with her I was like oh alright, she s kind of a bitch. Golden rule kinda thing, would I even want to be with a girl who shut down our date in front of a stranger? This guy though, he s funny and nice, good looking, seems like he d be a pal. So at the end of their night she goes to the bathroom and I start chatting it up with this guy about how embarrassing the whole situation seemed in the beginning. Guy is super cool, he s like yeah man turns out she has a boyfriend anyway, jokes on us, but I live up the street if you wanna grab a beer sometime. He tipped 25 . Funny thing is they friended me on Facebook after. EDIT: he just passed my job and ducked in with his buddy to say hey and we made a beer date haha\n\n### Video Caption ###\nThe server offered a drink to the waiting guest upon seating.

The video caption does not provide information about the waiter's behavior. The service was described as \"OK\" so the score is 3, meaning basic friendliness but lacks personalization.\n\ne) **Tangibles:** 4.

Charge him for something that’s like $0.70, and he leaves me another $20. \n\nMade my night and, not sure if he saw, but i teared up. It was really busy and the kitchen was just not on par that day.

Good at first until things that were out of my control happened, which I understand is something to be upset about, but not at me for. There s literally nothing I can do about our drafts not working and us being out of a certain soda, about our small kids menu which, sorry for not having a three tier menu for your 3 year old?!? and about not getting somebody their side of chicken for their nachos when I repeated the order to them beforehand and have now gotten in the weeds and just have been unable to bring you your chicken because i have 7 other tables to bring food to, bring drinks to, and take orders from. The last thing on my priority list is getting you your chicken especially bc you already have your meal and you didn t ask for it beforehand!!!!!!! Anyways, they left me a 20 on a 170 180? tab, but pretty much gave me attitude the whole time so it didn t feel good at all, but whatever, 20 is 20. One of the guys came back from the group after they all left and asked me to charge him for something so he could leave a tip, that he didn t like how they were with their tips. Charge him for something that s like 0.70, and he leaves me another 20. Made my night and, not sure if he saw, but i teared up. It was really busy and the kitchen was just not on par that day. He told me he was a server once too, so he knows how it is.\n\n### Video Caption ###\nThe server managed a large party of 8-9 people in a busy restaurant environment with a slow kitchen. The server communicated unavailable drink options to the table. A side item for the nachos was not delivered to the table after the main meal was served. This omission occurred because the server became overwhelmed with tasks from multiple tables.\n\n### User Input ###\n    1. Country: USA, Type: Casual dining\n    2.

Response times were likely delayed.\n    c) Assurance: 3 - The server was probably able to explain the menu.\n        *Reasoning:* The server handled the situation with the party and communicated the menu items.\n    d) Empathy: 3 - The server was likely friendly but may have not gone above and beyond due to being overwhelmed.\n        *Reasoning:* The server maintained a level of friendliness and communicated the unavailability of drinks.\n    e) Tangibles: 4 - The restaurant should generally be clean.\n        *Reasoning:* Assuming a generally clean restaurant, based on the context of the situation.\n\n1-2.

    "text_content": "I’ve been a server for 2-3 years now. I’m usually pretty good at keeping my temper in line. I’ve had a rough summer between the off season and health issues so I virtually made no money from mid June-mid September which doesn’t help pay my bills. \n\nWe all typically have a good feeling about certain tables and if they’re going to tip or not. I started serving a 3 top, and I just had the vibes that they were comment tippers. They ordered multiple expensive drinks, ordered food (complained about and I fixed and got them entirely new meals) and made jokes with them and followed exactly what they wanted. They had 2 friends join them towards the end of the meal, and I was really hoping another one would show up because I would able to add an automatic gratuity if they were a party of 6. \n\nThe night goes on and they’ve been with me for a total of 3 hours. I went to my boss and asked him if we could add the auto grat because their bill was $350 and climbing. And I just had this horrible sinking feeling they were going to stiff me. He said we couldn’t and even my other coworkers were like hey they’re going to fuck her over. Time comes for the bill and they split it. One girl handed me $20 bill and the others signed their slips. Our policy is to grab the checks while they’re on the table after being signed to say a pleasant goodnight spiel. I do so and see how they all didn’t leave me a single tip. \n\nI got a 5% tip for 3 hours of work and lost out on $100 between them not tipping and having to still tip out. I was absolutely fuming pissed. So I went and took the $20 and put it back on their table and said have a good night and walked back inside. A few minutes later I get all 5 of them running in yelling at me about how disrespectful and rude I am. \n\nI blankly looked at them and told them “I’m sorry you perceived it that way but I find it disrespectful and disgusting to tip a server 5% when they just busted their ass off for you for 3 hours.” \n\nThey tried to yell at me and say why didn’t I come and ask for more tip then why be “shady”. I said that I shouldnt have to come and ask why I wasn’t given a proper tip when you yourself told me how amazing of a server I was for you, and that maybe next time don’t let your man order 6 $25 cocktails. If you can’t afford to tip don’t go out to eat. \n\nMy manager was there for the whole thing and kinda let me say my peace at least. Their only complaint to him was me slamming the money down on the table. They even confirmed I was a good server. And yet still left me nothing. But it felt so good to tell them off. Because this is not okay to do to servers.\n\nEdit to add; if all your going to say is “your boss owes you a living wage” seriously stop. I’m legit doing the absolute best I can at a place that typically makes me good money. I can’t fix the US system so stop blaming my Owner when he’s legit trying to pay us more hourly currently.",

I m usually pretty good at keeping my temper in line. I ve had a rough summer between the off season and health issues so I virtually made no money from mid June mid September which doesn t help pay my bills. We all typically have a good feeling about certain tables and if they re going to tip or not. I started serving a 3 top, and I just had the vibes that they were comment tippers. They ordered multiple expensive drinks, ordered food complained about and I fixed and got them entirely new meals and made jokes with them and followed exactly what they wanted. They had 2 friends join them towards the end of the meal, and I was really hoping another one would show up because I would able to add an automatic gratuity if they were a party of 6. The night goes on and they ve been with me for a total of 3 hours. I went to my boss and asked him if we could add the auto grat because their bill was 350 and climbing. And I just had this horrible sinking feeling they were going to stiff me. He said we couldn t and even my other coworkers were like hey they re going to fuck her over. Time comes for the bill and they split it. One girl handed me 20 bill and the others signed their slips. Our policy is to grab the checks while they re on the table after being signed to say a pleasant goodnight spiel. I do so and see how they all didn t leave me a single tip. I got a 5 tip for 3 hours of work and lost out on 100 between them not tipping and having to still tip out. I was absolutely fuming pissed. So I went and took the 20 and put it back on their table and said have a good night and walked back inside. A few minutes later I get all 5 of them running in yelling at me about how disrespectful and rude I am. I blankly looked at them and told them I m sorry you perceived it that way but I find it disrespectful and disgusting to tip a server 5 when they just busted their ass off for you for 3 hours. They tried to yell at me and say why didn t I come and ask for more tip then why be shady . I said that I shouldnt have to come and ask why I wasn t given a proper tip when you yourself told me how amazing of a server I was for you, and that maybe next time don t let your man order 6 25 cocktails. If you can t afford to tip don t go out to eat. My manager was there for the whole thing and kinda let me say my peace at least. Their only complaint to him was me slamming the money down on the table. They even confirmed I was a good server. And yet still left me nothing. But it felt so good to tell them off. Because this is not okay to do to servers. Edit to add; if all your going to say is your boss owes you a living wage seriously stop. I m legit doing the absolute best I can at a place that typically makes me good money. I can t fix the US system so stop blaming my Owner when he s legit trying to pay us more hourly currently.\n\n### Video Caption ###\nThe server provided service for three hours to a party, including fixing a complaint by getting them entirely new meals and making jokes.

Despite the effort, the customers left a very small tip, leading to a confrontation.\n\n1-1. Video Evaluation Criteria\n\n*   **a) Reliability:** 5 - The server accurately fulfilled all requests, including correcting a complaint and providing new meals. The caption explicitly states they followed customer requests accurately.\n*   **b) Responsiveness:** 5 - While not explicitly stated, the actions described (fixing the complaint, making jokes, following requests) suggest prompt and attentive service. The server was responsive to the customers' needs.\n*   **c) Assurance:** 4 - The server's ability to handle the complaint, offer solutions, and interact in a friendly manner suggests they can explain the menu and handle customer concerns. However, the specifics of menu explanations are not mentioned, so a 4 is appropriate.\n*   **d) Empathy:** 3 - The server showed empathy by providing excellent service and attempting to meet the customers' needs and expectations. They made jokes and personalized the service.\n*   **e) Tangibles:** 4 - While cleanliness of the table and uniform are not directly described, the context of the service (fixing the complaint, making jokes) suggests a professional environment, though direct mentions are needed for a 5.\n\n1-2.

    "text_content": "I work at a fine dining restaurant that is between two large cities in my area. The clientel at this restaurant is generally business people, families, and people on dates. \n\n\nA few months ago, I was working on a Saturday night when a couple was sat in my section. Immediately, I noticed that they looked a bit out of place. The husband was wearing a t-shirt and jeans and the wife was sporting a similar outfit. No big deal, looks can often be deceiving. \n\n\nI give them the normal welcome spiel and dropped off a drink menu. The wife asks me quite a few questions regarding our white wines, and I bring her a sample of my favorite. She said it was good, and then asked for a Miller Lite. \n\n\nThey ordered their food and they seemed nice enough, but they were fairly unresponsive when I tried to chat with them. Again, no big deal. Some people like their space. \n\n\nAt one point, the wife's fork falls and I replace it. They cash out, and tip 15%. Annoying, but whatever. \n\n\nCue Monday morning. I walk up to my manager's office, and he asks if I remember a couple that sat at table 24 last Saturday night. I said yes, obviously nervous that they had complained about something that they hadn't told me about. \n\n\nMy manager is literally holding back laughter as he says,\n\n\"They called and told me that they couldn't enjoy their dinner because the wife's fork fell to the ground not once, but twice. They said that the floor had to be magnetic, and it's all they've been talking about since.\"\n\n\nWe both burst out laughing.\n\n\nComplaining about magnetic floors is the most creative complaint I have ever, and probably will ever, hear.\n\n\nEdit: 1. No, I wasn't assuming these people were shit because of what they were wearing. We just don't get people in casual clothing often, so they stood out. Many fine-dining restaurants won't seat people in casual clothing, but we don't have a dress code.\n\n2. As a server for 6 years, 20% has been known as the standard tipping amount for quality service, while 15% has become \"less than quality service\". In fine dining this is more of the standard than in fast-casual dining, at least in my experience serving in both environments, but I never (personally) tip less than 20% to a server regardless of the restaurant unless it was really bad service.\n\n\nEdit #2: In this restaurant, 18% is suggested gratuity. It says so on the bill. 22% is added to the bill in parties of 20 or more. My last hourly check was $0.20. My car payments, my rent, my tuition, and my general well-being relies on the tips I receive. The same case goes for most all servers in the U.S. Until the tip system changes, 20% is the (general) standard, and it's what keeps servers like myself afloat.\n\n\nEdit #3: I posted this because I thought that having a complaint about MAGNETIC FLOORS was pretty ridiculous and others would agree. Why is everyone making this entire post a debate!?",

    "text_content": "This is a long story, but I’ll do my best to sum it up in short fashion. (Sorry for formatting; I’m on mobile.)\n\nMy dad’s step-brother and his wife frequently call on me to get them tables at the extremely busy Italian restaurant where I work. These are the two wealthiest people I know. I’m talking a house in the hills, tons of cars; private school, the whole shebang. My restaurant is operated on a no-reservations basis, so every time I save them a table I’m breaking the rules. This time may have been the last. \n\n\nUncle’s wife texts me in the afternoon as I’m getting ready for work (for my first ever serving shift! I’m usually a host or busser) and says that they’re bringing the kids in at 6:00 and that I need to save them a table inside. I explain to her that it’s my first night ever of serving, so I’ll save them a table in my section. \n\n6:00 comes around and my night has been GREAT so far! Most of my tables are sweethearts, everything is coming out of the kitchen on time, etc. In walks my entitled family, and they proceed to run me absolutely ragged for 2.5 hours. Their glasses are smudged, their drinks aren’t strong enough, you get the idea. I comp their desserts and coffees because, you know, I’m nice and thought that family should take care of family. I wrap up service, thank them for coming in, and make my escape. \n\nMinutes later, I return to the table to find that they have tipped me 12%. Luckily, my other tables more than made up for that and I had an overall stellar first night of serving. Am I overreacting, or was this a total slap in the face?",

Video Evaluation Criteria & Scoring (Based on the Reddit Post and Video Caption)**\n\n*   **a) Reliability:** 2. The Reddit post mentions that the family complained about the drinks not being strong enough and other issues. While the server did their best and was nice, the complaints point to some issues with order accuracy or satisfaction.\n*   **b) Responsiveness:** 3. While the caption does not provide details about the speed of response, the post states the family was \"demanding\" and glasses were \"smudged,\" indicating responsiveness was likely average.\n*   **c) Assurance:** 3. The server was likely able to answer menu questions (as they are a server), but the post doesn't mention anything about the server's confidence or expertise in making suggestions.\n*   **d) Empathy:** 3. The server comped desserts and coffee, demonstrating some level of empathy and an attempt to please the family. They are being nice.\n*   **e) Tangibles:** 3. The post mentions smudged glasses. The caption does not make mention of the cleanliness of the uniform.\n\n**1-2. Video Score Calculation**\n\nVideo Score = (2 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3) * 4 = 56\n\n**5. Total Score**\n\n**5-1.

This suggests negative customer satisfaction, even though the server was trying to be kind.\n\n    *   **Final Tip Percentage:** Given the negative experience described in the post and the low tip received, I am choosing a tip percentage at the low end of the \"Normal\" range. Since the server was family, I will move to the upper end because comped services are family. Based on the calculation I am calculating 10%.\n\n**6-2.

I was super stoked because anything with 6 people or more gets an automatic 20% Gratuity.\n\nANYWAYS, they stagger in, and it ends up being like 25 people. I have all of their drinks in and on the table, and Im now starting to get food orders. Some people are being super annoying and getting up and moving around, but I'm managing.\n\nSo im like 10 people in, and then they tell me its going to be all separate checks. LOL - No its not. I tell the guy whose like \"in charge\" that with a party this large I can only do 1 check. My manager agrees with me that we arent going to split that fucking bill up, especially after theyve all been switching seats and ordered a whole bunch of shit already. So he gives me a card, and just tells me to keep him up to date with the total. No worries - PHEW.\n\nAnd I take the orders, put them in, and then a little bit later go around to check on drinks, its super hard to get peoples attention, so I'm going 1 by 1, and next to me, MAYBE a foot away, a girl goes \"Where the fuck is our server\" and I just pop my head next to her and say \"Shes right here. What can I get for you.\" she looks embarrassed, as she should be, because - what the fuck? She wants a drink. Done.\n\nAnyways, its just a super demanding table, and i have to turn down other tables from the hostess because I wouldnt be able to handle this table plus more than maybe 2 other small tables.\n\nFood starts coming to the expo line, so I go to take mine (and i know theyre mine because they had super specific mods), and another server tries to fucking take my food to his table. And I stop him and say \"No dude, this is for my table, here's my ticket\" and he tries arguing with me, and im showing him the mods, and hes still not backing down and the kitchen comes out to tell him that it is indeed mine. So now hes YELLING at me \"Why are all these fucking dishes up here! Take your plates! What are you doing?!\" and i LOSE it yall.\n\nI scream back \"Im TRYING to take my fucking dishes, but youre sitting over here BITCHING and FUCKING around and not LISTENING. SO FUCK OFF.\"\n\nEveryone gets there food.\n\nMain dude wants to close the check, so I bring him the itemized bill, and it also shows the auto gratuity added and the new total with the gratuity. I dont know if he didnt look or if he just felt bad for me, but I got a double tip and made 300$ on that table. \n\nTHANK fucking GANESH.",

I was super stoked because anything with 6 people or more gets an automatic 20 Gratuity. ANYWAYS, they stagger in, and it ends up being like 25 people. I have all of their drinks in and on the table, and Im now starting to get food orders. Some people are being super annoying and getting up and moving around, but I'm managing. So im like 10 people in, and then they tell me its going to be all separate checks. LOL No its not. I tell the guy whose like \"in charge\" that with a party this large I can only do 1 check. My manager agrees with me that we arent going to split that fucking bill up, especially after theyve all been switching seats and ordered a whole bunch of shit already. So he gives me a card, and just tells me to keep him up to date with the total. No worries PHEW. And I take the orders, put them in, and then a little bit later go around to check on drinks, its super hard to get peoples attention, so I'm going 1 by 1, and next to me, MAYBE a foot away, a girl goes \"Where the fuck is our server\" and I just pop my head next to her and say \"Shes right here. What can I get for you.\" she looks embarrassed, as she should be, because what the fuck? She wants a drink. Done. Anyways, its just a super demanding table, and i have to turn down other tables from the hostess because I wouldnt be able to handle this table plus more than maybe 2 other small tables. Food starts coming to the expo line, so I go to take mine and i know theyre mine because they had super specific mods , and another server tries to fucking take my food to his table. And I stop him and say \"No dude, this is for my table, here's my ticket\" and he tries arguing with me, and im showing him the mods, and hes still not backing down and the kitchen comes out to tell him that it is indeed mine. So now hes YELLING at me \"Why are all these fucking dishes up here! Take your plates! What are you doing?!\" and i LOSE it yall. I scream back \"Im TRYING to take my fucking dishes, but youre sitting over here BITCHING and FUCKING around and not LISTENING. SO FUCK OFF.\" Everyone gets there food. Main dude wants to close the check, so I bring him the itemized bill, and it also shows the auto gratuity added and the new total with the gratuity. I dont know if he didnt look or if he just felt bad for me, but I got a double tip and made 300 on that table. THANK fucking GANESH.\n\n### Video Caption ###\nThe server managed a challenging party of 25 people, successfully taking all drink and food orders and enforcing the restaurant's policy regarding checks for large groups.

The bar makes all of your alcohol that you sell, that margarita you sold, you didn't make that shit taste perfect for your guests, the bar did. Thinking that you shouldn't give them anything for helping *you* make that money is selfish and greedy. Be appreciative that you have someone to do these things for you, and give them that $10.00 out of the $130.00 you made tonight.

The video mentions dirty tables, but there is no information regarding order mistakes, but the focus is on the server's attitude toward the bussers. So it is safe to assume that there are no order mistakes or billing errors.\n    *   **Justification:** The video does not provide any information about the server's reliability in taking orders, handling requests, or managing the bill. However, the tables were dirty, indicating that there was an issue with the overall cleanliness of the service.\n*   **b) Responsiveness:** 3. There is no direct information about how quickly the server responded to customer requests in the video. However, the server's attitude suggests a lack of willingness to help the support staff.\n    *   **Justification:** The video focuses on the server's negative attitude towards the bussers. This could translate to slow responsiveness to customer requests.\n*   **c) Assurance:** 2. The server's behavior indicates a lack of confidence or professionalism. His attitude is negative and suggests he may not be capable of handling customer issues or menu questions effectively.\n    *   **Justification:** The server's negative attitude and his comment about the bussers indicate a lack of confidence and professionalism.\n*   **d) Empathy:** 1. The server's comment demonstrates a lack of empathy for the support staff. His actions were selfish and greedy, and did not show any care for the guests.\n    *   **Justification:** The video highlights the server's negative attitude towards the bussers, indicating a lack of empathy for the people he works with and also customers.\n*   **e) Tangibles:** 3. The video mentions dirty tables. This indicates a lack of attention to detail, as the server did not take care of his table.\n    *   **Justification:** The tables being dirty indicate that the server didn't pay attention to the details and it affected the tangibles aspect of the service.\n\n**1-2. Video Score Calculation**\n\nVideo Score = (Reliability + Responsiveness + Assurance + Empathy + Tangibles) \\* 4\nVideo Score = (2 + 3 + 2 + 1 + 3) \\* 4\nVideo Score = 44\n\n**5.

Calculate the tip based on the total score and analysis.**\n\n*   The total score of 44 falls into the \"Poor\" category.\n*   The restaurant type is casual dining in the USA, the range is [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]%.\n*   The video and the Reddit post reflect negativity due to the server's attitude towards the bussers.\n*   There are no ethical issues mentioned that would warrant a 0% tip.\n\n**6-2. Format**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"### Video Caption i(th) ###\": \"1 The server's tables were noted as dirty, prompting a request for busser assistance.

I was gonna head over to greet her when I'm told that she was actually here to pick up an online order. Again, no big deal. We weren't busy and sometimes customers who order online just sit at a table while they wait. I go out to check on her and she lets me know she already ordered and she wants me to bring it out to her when it's finished. Also, she'd like a water and a margarita. I grudgingly ring in her marg and bring it out to her and she tells me that she'll be enjoying her meal on the patio. \"I know that's gotta mess you up, sorry!\" I grit my teeth and keep my server smile on because I know my MOD won't have my back on a confrontation with her. She gets her food, she drinks her margarita, she hangs out for like an hour and then she goes. But here's the kicker: she tipped 10% on her online order, which I won't see a penny of since online order tips go to the bar. She tipped 20% on the margarita though, which was nice. Except for the fact that 6% of my total alcohol sales go to the bar, so I actually only made 14%. She got a meal, a margarita, and took up space in my section for over an hour and tipped less than $5 between the two orders. I made just about $1 serving her.",

The server also displayed professional confidence by not engaging in the customer's inappropriate behavior.\n*   **d) Empathy:** Score: 3. The server maintained a \"server smile\" and appeared to be managing the situation with composure. It is a reasonable display of empathy.\n*   **e) Tangibles:** Score: 4.

Tipping percentages are between 6% and 15%.\n    *   The reviews highlight the customer's negative experience. The user tipped 20% on the margarita and 10% on the online order (bar only) but the net outcome shows the server earned $1. The video displays professionalism despite unusual circumstances and a difficult customer.\n\n    The tip should be at the low end of the \"Normal\" range due to the fact that a high tip percentage doesn't equate to a high payout.

    "text_content": "I have been serving for 6 years and I like having this sub to rant on but for all that is good and holy stop commenting on things you know nothing about.\n\nFIRST AND FOREMOST. Servers are people, they make mistakes, they forget things, and sometimes we’re run so ragged pulling overtime hours for shit pay. Did you know most of us make $2.15 an hour? So yes, anything under a 20% tip, most of us consider a “stiff”\n\nSECOND. We do not get to keep all our tips. The place I work, management expects us to pay for others paychecks. That means our hosts, bussers, hell even our dishpit gets fucked. They make way less hourly because management wants our tips to go to them so they get to pay them less under that excuse. That being said, a big table comes in, $200+ and you leave 10-15%? You’re fucking me, my host, my busser, and my dishpit because the less money I make? The less they make. You think $20 is worth all the crap of the cooks trying to get your food out in a timely manner, causing that many dishes to pile up that the dish has to rush to turn around just so we can set the table for the next party, the busser scrambling to make the table look nice including a quick vacuum because your crotch goblins spilled food everywhere, and the host going out of their way to top off your drinks was worth it? $20 for four+ people isn’t considered a “stiff” to you?\n\nAnd THIRD. People have to wait. Yes, things are getting better, but for the next three days I will be your only server for that time slot. If you all expect to just walk in and have a nice sit down meal IMMEDIATELY? You’re dead wrong. I’m busting my ass bringing 11 more ranch and running drinks to 53 and apps to 42 but fuck! 41’s order is up and I can’t let that sit in the window because it’ll go bad, but I also have to type in the order for 31 because they all ordered burgs done different temps and with different cheeses and sides and our system sucks so now I have to go tell the kitchen this person doesn’t want this on their burger because I don’t have an option to type that in. And I swear to god I am RUNNING trying to get everything out to people. So I’m sorry you just walked out instead of giving me those extra ten minutes.\n\nI’m just sick of using this sub to rant and just get nasty comments from those of you who have no clue what it’s like to work in a restaurant. And I honestly have it pretty good compared to others I’ve seen post here. Or is it just me getting shit from people when I post and I should just figure out another way to let off some steam besides this sub?",

FIRST AND FOREMOST. Servers are people, they make mistakes, they forget things, and sometimes we re run so ragged pulling overtime hours for shit pay. Did you know most of us make 2.15 an hour? So yes, anything under a 20 tip, most of us consider a stiff SECOND. We do not get to keep all our tips. The place I work, management expects us to pay for others paychecks. That means our hosts, bussers, hell even our dishpit gets fucked. They make way less hourly because management wants our tips to go to them so they get to pay them less under that excuse. That being said, a big table comes in, 200 and you leave 10 15 ? You re fucking me, my host, my busser, and my dishpit because the less money I make? The less they make. You think 20 is worth all the crap of the cooks trying to get your food out in a timely manner, causing that many dishes to pile up that the dish has to rush to turn around just so we can set the table for the next party, the busser scrambling to make the table look nice including a quick vacuum because your crotch goblins spilled food everywhere, and the host going out of their way to top off your drinks was worth it? 20 for four people isn t considered a stiff to you? And THIRD. People have to wait. Yes, things are getting better, but for the next three days I will be your only server for that time slot. If you all expect to just walk in and have a nice sit down meal IMMEDIATELY? You re dead wrong. I m busting my ass bringing 11 more ranch and running drinks to 53 and apps to 42 but fuck! 41 s order is up and I can t let that sit in the window because it ll go bad, but I also have to type in the order for 31 because they all ordered burgs done different temps and with different cheeses and sides and our system sucks so now I have to go tell the kitchen this person doesn t want this on their burger because I don t have an option to type that in. And I swear to god I am RUNNING trying to get everything out to people. So I m sorry you just walked out instead of giving me those extra ten minutes. I m just sick of using this sub to rant and just get nasty comments from those of you who have no clue what it s like to work in a restaurant. And I honestly have it pretty good compared to others I ve seen post here. Or is it just me getting shit from people when I post and I should just figure out another way to let off some steam besides this sub?\n\n### Video Caption ###\nThe server reports being the sole server during shifts and extremely busy, actively managing multiple tables, delivering items like ranch and drinks, and handling complex food orders.

We all just laughed, didn't really say anything since we didn't know she was being serious at the time. \n\nSecond time she came around, she said \"You know, I wasn't being sarcastic!\" and left to go help another table. At that point, the guy with the $100 just got up and asked her for his change back. She was apologetic, but seemed surprised that we actually hadn't tipped her $40. \n\nNow, don't get me wrong, she was attentive to our table, got us our stuff quickly, but was she hoping we'd just say \"she's right, she *did* give good service) and leave/not make a fuss? I've never worked as a server, so I don't know.\n\nAnd before anyone calls me out... our table left $15 as a tip.

For context I’m 26 but I look much younger and I’m also kind of socially awkward - like sometimes it takes me a second to realize someone is joking. It normally works out because I look young so it plays into the whole “young naive girl server” stereotype. It’s a slow Sunday night around 7 PM and I’ve been there since 11 AM and didn’t get home until almost 1:30 on Saturday night so to say I’m sleep deprived is an understatement.\n\n\nOn my way to the kitchen with some dishes I see an older lady get sat at one of my tables and the host puts down three menus at the table. I go ahead and get 3 app plates and some complimentary bread for the table.\n\nMe: Hey my name is philaenopsis, I’ll be your server tonight. Can I get you started off with a drink or appetizer while you wait for the rest of your party to arrive?\n\nLady: I’ll go ahead and take a water. My son might order some mozzarella sticks when he gets here but I’m not sure (not the actual appetizer because if I said the appetizer it would give away where I work. For the sake of the story the app is mozzarella sticks.)\n\nMe: Awesome, I’ll be right back with your water\n\nThe rest of the party arrives, it’s the lady’s husband and their grown son. He looks like he’s probably in his early-mid 30s. I go ahead and get their drink orders and bring them out.\n\nMe: Alright, and were we still thinking about getting an appetizer or we ready to order entrees?\n\nSon: Well I want some mozzarella sticks but I don’t want a whole appetizer. Is there any way for me to get a smaller portion?\n\nMe: Well we do have a burger that comes with mozzarella sticks so there may be a way for me to ring them in as an add on in a smaller portion. Let me go check with my manager.\n\nI’m looking on the POS to see if there’s any option to add on mozz sticks on any of the add on screens. My manager confirms the only way to get mozz sticks is to either get the app or the burger. I go back to the table\n\nMe: I’m so sorry, unfortunately the only way to get mozz sticks is to order the burger or the appetizer.\n\nAt this point the son gets really intense, almost seems angry. He starts making aggressive eye contact with me.\n\nSon: Well I don’t want a full appetizer but I’m going to have mozzarella sticks\n\nMe: So you wanted to do the burger then…?\n\nHim: No I don’t want them on a burger, but I’m going to have mozzarella sticks. The mozzarella sticks are the only reason I come here, they’re so good.\n\nMe: so then did you want to order the appetizer? I’m confused.\n\nWe go back and forth like this a few times, him insisting he’s going to get mozzarella sticks but doesn’t want the burger or the app. I keep explaining to him those are the only two ways to get mozzarella sticks until he finally gets frustrated and says forget it and he needs a minute with the menu. I go back to the back and tell my manager about the situation, mostly venting about how rude this guy is being to me. She goes and talks to the table, comes back and tells me she’s giving him a few mozzarella sticks on the house but asked that they tip generously since they didn’t get charged. I go back to the table to get their orders, they have a few questions about the menu which I answer. The mom gets a a ceasar salad and dad gets a small sirloin.\n\nSon: If I wanted a cheeseburger with bacon how would you recommend I order it?\n\nMe: well we have two burgers on our menu and the both come with cheese by default and you can add bacon to either. One of the burgers comes with mozz sticks and you said you love the mozz sticks so I’d recommend you get that one.\n\nHe rolls his eyes.\n\nSon: no, I’ll just do the regular burger with American and bacon, no onion no lettuce extra pickles and tomato with ketchup and mustard.\n\nNow we’ve just switched over to tablets instead of taking orders in a traditional book.

It s a slow Sunday night around 7 PM and I ve been there since 11 AM and didn t get home until almost 1:30 on Saturday night so to say I m sleep deprived is an understatement. On my way to the kitchen with some dishes I see an older lady get sat at one of my tables and the host puts down three menus at the table. I go ahead and get 3 app plates and some complimentary bread for the table. Me: Hey my name is philaenopsis, I ll be your server tonight.

    "text_content": "I’m new to the service industry as I started working as a waitress a few weeks ago and I need to rant about some of the things that have been bugging me hugely\n\nFirstly, the amount of food that gets wasted?? So many people will order a huge amount of food and just leave half of it untouched and because of covid blah blah blah all we can do is scrape it into the bin. It makes me feel so shit standing in front of some of the kitchen staff who are working a minimum wage job to support their families and parents and siblings and having to scrape an entire plate of food into the bin because people just decided to order a huge meal and eat an eighth of it \n\nSecondly, people are such dicks. The amount of people who treat you like you’re less than them because you’re working as a waitress blows my mind. Last week we had a woman come in with her daughter and a bunch of other kids to celebrate her birthday. Where I work, if we’re hosting an event or party we will set up the tables nicely but require people to bring their own decorations etc ready to be placed on the table. I was the unfortunate soul serving this table and while I’m busy making about 20 milkshakes the mother comes to me with big ass balloons and tells me to blow them up and take them out with the milkshakes. Not my job lady and I’m busy. Between me and the other servers we manage to get all her decorations sorted and taken out with the milkshakes. Catered to these childrens every request and got tipped less than 5%. And she didn’t even get charged the small fee we usually charge to host parties. \n\nLastly, people changing their minds last minute drives me up the wall. Yesterday a woman ordered a cappuccino with cream. I checked twice that she wanted cream instead of foam and she was adamant that she did. Make the coffee and take it to her when she says no she wanted foam. Took it back and just scooped the cream out with a spoon and filled it with foam. Should I have made her a new one? Yes. Did I feel like doing it in the middle of the lunch rush? No. Another customer had ordered a waffle with a caramel sauce, take it to her and she knocks it over and requests another one. Go back to the kitchen which was already chaotic because again, lunch time rush, request a fresh sauce, take it out to her and she says “oh never mind, I don’t need the sauce anymore. Something else that just has to go in the bin. \n\nPeople make me f*cking insane",

So many people will order a huge amount of food and just leave half of it untouched and because of covid blah blah blah all we can do is scrape it into the bin. It makes me feel so shit standing in front of some of the kitchen staff who are working a minimum wage job to support their families and parents and siblings and having to scrape an entire plate of food into the bin because people just decided to order a huge meal and eat an eighth of it Secondly, people are such dicks. The amount of people who treat you like you re less than them because you re working as a waitress blows my mind. Last week we had a woman come in with her daughter and a bunch of other kids to celebrate her birthday. Where I work, if we re hosting an event or party we will set up the tables nicely but require people to bring their own decorations etc ready to be placed on the table. I was the unfortunate soul serving this table and while I m busy making about 20 milkshakes the mother comes to me with big ass balloons and tells me to blow them up and take them out with the milkshakes. Not my job lady and I m busy. Between me and the other servers we manage to get all her decorations sorted and taken out with the milkshakes. Catered to these childrens every request and got tipped less than 5 . And she didn t even get charged the small fee we usually charge to host parties. Lastly, people changing their minds last minute drives me up the wall. Yesterday a woman ordered a cappuccino with cream. I checked twice that she wanted cream instead of foam and she was adamant that she did. Make the coffee and take it to her when she says no she wanted foam. Took it back and just scooped the cream out with a spoon and filled it with foam. Should I have made her a new one? Yes. Did I feel like doing it in the middle of the lunch rush? No. Another customer had ordered a waffle with a caramel sauce, take it to her and she knocks it over and requests another one. Go back to the kitchen which was already chaotic because again, lunch time rush, request a fresh sauce, take it out to her and she says oh never mind, I don t need the sauce anymore. Something else that just has to go in the bin. People make me f cking insane\n\n### Video Caption ###\nThe server handled a large birthday party, catering to children's requests and assisting with decorations despite being busy making drinks. The server confirmed a coffee order twice, made it correctly, but when the customer changed their mind, partially corrected it by scooping out cream instead of remaking the drink during a lunch rush. The server also promptly retrieved a replacement sauce for a spilled item during the rush, only for the customer to decline it upon delivery.\n\n### User Input ###\n    1.

The server also promptly addressed the spilled item by retrieving a new sauce. However, the server did not remake the coffee, which could be considered a minor omission.\n*   **b) Responsiveness:** 4. The server quickly addressed requests. Despite being busy, the server assisted with the party decorations and promptly retrieved a replacement sauce.\n*   **c) Assurance:** 3. The server confirmed the coffee order, suggesting an attempt to provide confident service. However, the server did not remake the coffee.\n*   **d) Empathy:** 3. The server catered to the children's requests.\n*   **e) Tangibles:** 4. The video description doesn't comment on this\n\n1-2.

Calculate the tip based on the total score and analysis.\n\n    *   **Service Level:** 68 points put the service level in the \"Normal\" category.\n    *   **Tipping Percentage:** Since the country is USA and the restaurant type is casual dining, the tipping range is Normal [6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15]%.\n    *   **Review Sentiment:** The Reddit post contains both positive and negative aspects. While the server was put in difficult positions due to customers, the server was polite and helpful.\n    *   **Final Tip Percentage:** Due to the circumstances, I'll apply a 12% tip.\n\n    6-2.

I came back an hour later to get myself some food and they were STILL there having other servers get them mimosas. So was it worth it? I don't even know.\n\n### Video Caption ###\nThe server provided frequent bottomless mimosa refills, running frantically to keep up with demand under busy conditions. Due to beverage shortages, alternative juices (grapefruit, pineapple) were used for mimosas. The server stayed 1.5 hours past their scheduled shift to continue serving one table, eventually asking them directly to check out.\n\n### User Input ###\n    1.

Video Evaluation Criteria**\n\n*   **a) Reliability:** 3 - Mostly accurate orders, occasional lack of confirmation.\n    *   **Reason:** The server was primarily responsible for drink refills, and the video doesn't show any order inaccuracies. The server had to handle a high-volume order of bottomless mimosas, which could be seen as managing a lot of orders.\n*   **b) Responsiveness:** 3 - Average response speed, acceptable performance.\n    *   **Reason:** The server was responsive to drink refill requests and did their best to fulfill orders. The server was stretched thin due to the high demand for bottomless mimosas and limited resources.\n*   **c) Assurance:** 4 - Professional explanations, confident handling.\n    *   **Reason:** The server calmly managed the situation, including providing alternative juice options when the restaurant ran out of orange juice. While the server was likely stressed, they professionally continued their service.\n*   **d) Empathy:** 3 - Basic friendliness but lacks personalization.\n    *   **Reason:** The server apologized for the delay and was polite when asking the customers to check out. However, the interactions were mostly functional due to the high-pressure environment.\n*   **e) Tangibles:** 4 - Uniform and table settings are tidy, cleanliness maintained.\n    *   **Reason:** There's no mention of issues with cleanliness or the table settings in the video description. The server appeared to be working in a clean and organized manner.\n\n**1-2. Video Score Calculation**\n\n*   Video Score = (3 + 3 + 4 + 3 + 4) \\* 4 = 68\n\n**5. Total Score**\n\n*   **5-1. Total Score Calculation**\n    *   Total Score = 68\n\n**6. Tip Calculation**\n\n*   **6-1. Calculate the tip based on the total score and analysis.**\n\n    *   The service level can be categorized as \"Normal\" because the total score is 68 and falls within that range. (Based on this guide for all criteria)\n    *   The tipping percentage range for Casual dining in the USA is 10–15%.\n    *   Since the server worked hard under pressure, provided multiple refills, and was polite even though the customers lingered, but given the fact that the customers were difficult and made the server stay well beyond their shift hours, and ultimately the tip was good, the tip should be on the higher end of the normal scale.\n\n*   **6-2.

I was a server for a party of 25. Can tell it s going to be a party that every time I go up to them they re going to need something, but whatever that s what I m there for. After running around non stop like a mad man I drop the check off to them and I hear someone yell out who the hell ordered the gratuity? pronounced it like ratatouille but with a g , In my head I m thinking to myself this is going to be fun to explain... I go over and explain to him that it s a 18 tip we charge for having such a large party, and I m sorry if no one brought this up while making the reservation. He asked if I can split the bill with multiple people, I tell him that s not a problem, and he asks if the gratuity is going to be on the new checks which I reply yes, you re still the same party just paying with multiple cards and he replies to me that s a 60 tip?! I m now standing there dumbfounded and no way am I going to try to explain to this man how percentages work. I go get my manager and everything ends up working but that story is one that will always stay with me.\n\n### Video Caption ###\nThe server managed a large party of 25, reporting high effort as they were \"running around non stop.\" They delivered the check and then explained the automatic 18% [REMOVED] policy when questioned, apologizing if it hadn't been communicated during the reservation. The server facilitated splitting the bill and involved a manager when unable to fully resolve a customer's misunderstanding about the percentage calculation.\n\n### User Input ###\n    1.

Key observations include:\n\n    *   The server demonstrated high effort (\"running around non-stop\").\n    *   The server clearly explained the gratuity policy (18%).\n    *   The server assisted with splitting the bill.\n    *   The server involved a manager to resolve a customer misunderstanding, showing a proactive approach to customer service.\n\n    Now I will score each criterion.\n\n    *   **a) Reliability:** 4 - The server accurately applied the gratuity policy and facilitated the bill splitting, demonstrating a good level of reliability. There were no order mistakes or billing errors from what the caption reports.\n        *   **Justification:** The caption suggests the server handled the situation professionally despite the customer's misunderstanding.\n    *   **b) Responsiveness:** 5 - The server responded immediately to the customer's query about the gratuity and bill splitting.\n        *   **Justification:** The server addressed the customer's concerns directly and promptly.\n    *   **c) Assurance:** 4 - The server confidently explained the restaurant's gratuity policy.\n        *   **Justification:** The server provided clear information.\n    *   **d) Empathy:** 3 - While the server was professional, the caption doesn't indicate significant personalization or attempts to create an exceptional experience. The server, however, had to deal with a difficult customer.\n        *   **Justification:** The server was efficient but not excessively attentive or personalized.\n    *   **e) Tangibles:** N/A - The video description does not provide any information about tangibles.\n        *   **Justification:** There is no information.\n\n2.  **Video Score Calculation:**\n\n    Video Score = (Reliability + Responsiveness + Assurance + Empathy) \\* 4\n    Video Score = (4 + 5 + 4 + 3) \\* 4\n    Video Score = 16 \\* 4\n    Video Score = 64\n\n3.  **Total Score**\n\n    5-1.

Calculate the tip based on the total score and analysis.\n\n    *   **Categorize the service level:** A score of 64 is high. Therefore the service level is Good.\n    *   **Determine the tipping percentage:** USA, Casual dining: Good [16, 17, 18, 19, 20]%. Considering that there was an 18% gratuity applied, the tip percentage should be 18%.\n\n    6-2.

I don't look like much and sometimes I'm convinced that servers are writing me off as a potential tip and as a consequence I get fair to neglectful service most of the time. If it's not outright horrible, I still leave 15% to 20%, but I usually tip even more than that for decent service. (Yes, I used to be a server and I know this is a hard job)\n\nPlaces I go regularly have now caught on and I get excellent service all the time, and I leave great tips there. But when I go to a new place, I often feel like they assume the worst, treat me badly, sometimes to the point that I feel badly about leaving a generous tip in vague hopes that I will get better service in the future.\n\nSo, what to do. I never got a tip BEFORE serving a table when I was working, but maybe that's a way to let people know I'm going to give a decent tip, so it's worth their effort to try to do a good job. Are there any other ways besides sticking to places that know me, to better signal that even as a dumpy looking nothing special guy I'm going to reward decent service well, and excellent service spectacularly?\n\nOkay here's an example. I met a friend for lunch and we were kind of leisurely about the whole thing. Catching up and talking for a while after we finished the meal. Service was fine, nothing special, but as we're chatting afterwards no one made any move to hurry us along or try to get us out of this table. In my opinion, this is great service and I left a great tip (more than 50%). But I can also see that it could have gone differently and more often than not it does, which I attribute to servers not thinking there's likely to be a good tip from the scruffy guy. This lunch worked great, but what can I do to increase my odds of good service. I'm willing to tip appropriately in appreciation of good service. How do I let servers know this in advance without sounding like \"I'll take care of you\" guy, who likely stiffs them in the end.\n",

    "text_content": "One day, I got a family of four. Right from the get go, they were pretty unfriendly. Whatever. It just means I'll keep our conversation to just asking what they need. One of the adults orders a lemonade (which we hand squeeze the lemon juice each morning and make it fresh, so it's $3.99 for an order, but free refills.) She guzzles down 4 glasses of it while she's there. Since the bartender has to pour the drinks, it's pretty frustrating. She also ordered a kids meal which is absolutely okay because of you don't feel like eating much, it's a perfect size. I'm thankful corporate doesn't go full Gestapo on kids meals because honestly, what difference does it make?\n\nAnyway, they're rude when they speak and give me the cold shoulder the rest of the time. I drop off their check and go make sure the rest of my tables are okay. The lady stops me from going to the back to get something. \"I thought drinks with the kids meal were free?\" I explain that yes, they're free of you're a kid under the age of 10 (because a kid under the age of 10 isn't going to drink four fucking glasses.) \"But I always get them for free with my kids take out order!\" Yes, because we are unable to verify that it's not going to kids. Luckily, my manager stepped up and confirmed what I had just said. They paid and left. Less than 10% tip but that's okay because I no longer had to deal with them. Also, when I said thank you for coming in and have a nice day, they couldn't even bother to respond.\n\nMust suck to be that hateful.",

Reason: The server accurately explained the drink policy, addressing the customer's question and clarifying the situation. The server demonstrated accurate information delivery.\n*   **b) Responsiveness:** Score: 4. Reason: The server responded to the customer's query promptly and provided a clear explanation. The promptness and clarity of the server's response indicate good responsiveness.\n*   **c) Assurance:** Score: 4. Reason: The server confidently explained the restaurant's policy, demonstrating competence and professionalism in handling the customer's inquiry.\n*   **d) Empathy:** Score: 3. Reason: The server handled a potentially difficult customer interaction professionally, but the video does not show any proactive attempts to create a positive experience. While the server was not rude and remained professional, it lacked the personal touch and understanding of customer emotion.\n*   **e) Tangibles:** Score: 4. Reason: While not explicitly stated, a casual dining restaurant is expected to maintain basic cleanliness and orderliness, which the video reflects. Uniform and table settings would be expected to be tidy.\n\n### 1-2. Video Score Calculation\n\nVideo Score = (5 + 4 + 4 + 3 + 4) \\* 4 = 80\n\n### 5. Total Score\n\n5-1.

Calculate the tip based on the total score and analysis.\n\n*   **Service Level:** The total video score is 80, which indicates a \"Good\" service level.\n*   **Tipping Percentage:** The restaurant is in the USA, with casual dining. Based on the USA Casual dining guide, the Good level range is 16-20%. The customer review is negative and the server provided a neutral service. Because the customer review is not positive, the tip will be on the lower end. 16%.\n\n*   **Ethical Considerations:** There are no ethical issues.\n\n6-2.

You three came in, ordered beers and sushi, then 2 more beers right before I turned off my open sign. One of you told me,\n\n“You know, you remind me of Rebel Wilson.” I told you that wasn’t exactly a compliment. You alluded to my weight not very subtly when you explained it wasn’t meant to be one. My manager and coworker tried cheering me up by telling me she’s beautiful, but not denying the underlying issue I had with your words. I couldn’t keep going with your table so my coworker paid you all out, a $120 bill. You all tipped a big fat zero. \n\nI did the liquor count in the cooler and took 10 minutes longer than I needed. My paper mask had wet patches by the time I came out. I’d been on my feet for 12 hours by then and, honestly, I just was shattered. My self confidence surrounding my 85 lb weight loss is gone. I haven’t eaten today but the thought of getting myself food right now makes me want to be sick. \n\nHow can you just... be cruel? Not only are you eating in a dine in restaurant in the middle of a pandemic, but you broke me in a way I didn’t think I could get hurt. One of you drove off in a Tesla. \n\nI hope your kids use their trust fund money for bettering the world. I hope they believe in organisations you don’t and they donate every penny. Fuck you.\n\nEDIT: Thanks for all the love. I know who I am now is an achievement and I know I am beautiful. I really appreciate the awards and messages and all that. \n\nAnd to those in the comments being rude about my sensitivity to this subject: ok. Go for it. Be a dick. At this point, I don’t even care anymore. There’s nothing you can say to me that I haven’t heard before.",

You three came in, ordered beers and sushi, then 2 more beers right before I turned off my open sign. One of you told me, You know, you remind me of Rebel Wilson. I told you that wasn t exactly a compliment. You alluded to my weight not very subtly when you explained it wasn t meant to be one. My manager and coworker tried cheering me up by telling me she s beautiful, but not denying the underlying issue I had with your words. I couldn t keep going with your table so my coworker paid you all out, a 120 bill. You all tipped a big fat zero. I did the liquor count in the cooler and took 10 minutes longer than I needed. My paper mask had wet patches by the time I came out. I d been on my feet for 12 hours by then and, honestly, I just was shattered. My self confidence surrounding my 85 lb weight loss is gone. I haven t eaten today but the thought of getting myself food right now makes me want to be sick. How can you just... be cruel? Not only are you eating in a dine in restaurant in the middle of a pandemic, but you broke me in a way I didn t think I could get hurt. One of you drove off in a Tesla. I hope your kids use their trust fund money for bettering the world. I hope they believe in organisations you don t and they donate every penny. Fuck you. EDIT: Thanks for all the love. I know who I am now is an achievement and I know I am beautiful. I really appreciate the awards and messages and all that. And to those in the comments being rude about my sensitivity to this subject: ok. Go for it. Be a dick. At this point, I don t even care anymore. There s nothing you can say to me that I haven t heard before.\n\n### Video Caption ###\nThe server took the initial and subsequent drink and food orders and interacted with the customers.

The server had to be relieved by a coworker due to emotional distress, indicating an inability to fulfill the order properly.\n    *   Justification: The Reddit post clearly states the server couldn't continue serving the table, which is a major failure in reliability.\n*   **b) Responsiveness:** Score: 1. The server's emotional state and inability to continue serving suggests a complete failure in responsiveness.\n    *   Justification: The server's emotional state and the need for a coworker to take over demonstrate a lack of responsiveness.\n*   **c) Assurance:** Score: 1. The server's emotional state and the customer interaction described in the post show the server's inability to provide assurance.\n    *   Justification: The server was in distress and the customers made negative comments, which wouldn't create a confident atmosphere.\n*   **d) Empathy:** Score: 1. The server's emotional distress suggests no empathy was demonstrated.\n    *   Justification: The customers' behavior caused the server emotional distress.\n*   **e) Tangibles:** Score: 3. While not directly mentioned in the video caption, the fact that the customers sat at a \"dirty table\" is mentioned in the Reddit post. However, since the video description does not include tangibles like a uniform, I will score this in the middle.\n    *   Justification: Although the video caption doesn't provide details about the tangibles, the \"dirty table\" is mentioned in the Reddit post.\n\n1-2.

I try to be understanding and patient as I cannot imagine doing what you folks do every day.  So thank you.   But,\n\nMy question is why is it so difficult for courses not to be served on top of each other?\n\nLast night we asked for a house salad in lieu of potatoes (on a diet).  Chris our server said no problem, but $3 up-charge.  \"No problem Chris, but can we get the salads before our entrees so we can eat them after our appetizers and before our fish?\"  He says no problem. \n\nAppetizers are great - delivered by someone other than Chris.  Salads delivered by Chris who very nicely offers and gives us some ground fresh pepper.\n\n2 minutes later, someone other than Chris drops our entrees.  I tell this woman our explicit request and she didn't really seem to care.  Chris stops by and goes, \"Wow, those came our fast. I told them about your request.\"  I am pissed, but not his fault.\n\nWe don't eat the salads.  We still get charged $6 for them.  Total bill is $90.  I leave $20 tip and leave pissed off.  Didn't say anything on the way out. Won't leave a bad review.  Just won't go back. My mantra is life is too short and I am trying not to hate on anyone.\n\nMy question is - I know that you have to turn tables fast, and we were there early, but is this that difficult a request?  Or is it they want to run us out fast?  Or is it so chaotic that it is a difficult thing to do?  If too difficult, why not tell me upfront it is not possible?\n\nLastly, should I have said something to management?",

    "response": "Okay, I will analyze the provided information and calculate an appropriate tip.\n\n### Analysis of the Reddit Post and Video\n\n1.  **Video Caption Analysis**\n    *   The video caption indicates a few issues with the service. Chris, the server, initially agreed to the customer's requests (salad substitution and course timing). However, the timing of the courses was not followed, with the entrees arriving too quickly after the salads.\n    *   **Reliability:** 3 - Mostly accurate orders, occasional lack of confirmation. Chris took the order correctly, but the kitchen and/or other staff failed to execute the timing request, which is a lack of proper confirmation.\n        *   Reasoning: The order was taken correctly, including the special requests. However, the kitchen's failure to adhere to the requested timing demonstrates a lack of proper execution and coordination.\n    *   **Responsiveness:** 4 - Quick and polite responses. Chris was responsive to the customer's requests, offering to fulfill them and delivering the salads himself.\n        *   Reasoning: Chris was polite and agreed to the requests, which suggests promptness.\n    *   **Assurance:** 3 - Can explain the menu but lacks confidence. The video doesn't directly show his explanations of the menu, but the problem is not about menu knowledge, rather execution of the requests.\n        *   Reasoning: Chris was able to take the order without issue, but he did not take ownership of the problem.\n    *   **Empathy:** 3 - Basic friendliness but lacks personalization. Chris acknowledged the timing issue, but didn't offer a solution or apologize.\n        *   Reasoning: Chris expressed some recognition of the customer's experience but failed to address the problem effectively.\n    *   **Tangibles:** (This can't be scored from the limited info in the prompt, so the following are based on assuming a standard restaurant.) 4 - Uniform and table settings are tidy, cleanliness maintained. (This is an assumption based on a standard restaurant.)\n        *   Reasoning: Assuming a standard restaurant, the cleanliness is likely maintained.\n2.  **Video Score Calculation**\n    *   Video Score = (3 + 4 + 3 + 3 + 4) \\* 4 = 68\n\n3.  **Total Score**\n    *   Total Score = Video Score = 68\n\n4.  **Tip Calculation**\n    *   Service Level: With a score of 68, the service is classified as **Normal** in a casual dining restaurant in the USA.\n    *   Tipping Percentage: In the USA for casual dining, \"Normal\" service means a tip range of 6-15%.\n    *   Reviews and Video Analysis: The Reddit post shows the customer was ultimately \"pissed off\" due to the issue with the course timing and being charged for the salads. Even though the customer didn't leave a bad review, their negative experience impacts the tip. Also, the server did the best that he could.\n    *   Final Tip Percentage: Considering the negativity of the experience and the customer's dissatisfaction, but the waiter also did the best he could, I'll choose the lower end of the \"Normal\" range, about 8%.\n    *   Final Tip Amount: $25.00 (subtotal) \\* 0.08 = $2.00\n    *   Final Total Bill: $25.00 (subtotal) + $2.00 (tip) = $27.00\n\n###Output indicator###\n```json\n    {\n      \"### Video Caption i(th) ###\": \"Server Chris confirmed requests for a salad substitution and course timing, stating \\\"no problem\\\" to both.

I try not to judge and I didn't until he started acting incredibly rude. \n\nHe interrupted me while I was greeting my next table. Instead of just waiting patiently like a normal human being he continued his interruption to ask for a refill.  And when I explained him that the specialty drink he ordered doesn't come with free refills he bitched and moaned about it. When I brought him a water instead he complained that the specialty drink he ordered wasn't free refills and bitched about it for like 2 more minutes about it.\n\nI apologize loudly to the table next to him that I had been trying to greet. \n\nWhen his food came out he complained about the size of his 16 oz Ribeye and insisted it wasn't the right size. I confirmed that it was and ran away.\n\nWhen I checked on him he complained that his ribeye was flavorless (bullshit). I offered to bring something to put on it (like au jus or gravy or sauce) or I could get him something else. It took me 5 minutes to get him to tell me he wanted something else. I finally almost lost my cool and just said \"What do you want me to do for you?!\"\nHe ordered a New York strip instead. \n\nTHEN he had the gall to act surprised when I took the ribeye away. Like he thought I was going to let him keep that steak for free and give him a new one. Sorry doesn't work that way.\n\nThe manager brings out his new plate. I go to check on him and ask him if this steak is better. He kind of gives me a 'meh' and complains about the size. I explain to him that the New York strip only comes in 12 ounce so it's going to be smaller than the one he ordered earlier. (At this point I'm convinced this fat slob had been banking on being able to keep both meals.) \n\nHe tips 2$ on a 28$ bill. \n\nBUT. The table next to this asshole (the one that I was greeting when asshole interrupted me) was the complete opposite. They were a young couple and very very polite.

He's fat, sweaty and his clothes smell like he left them in the wash for a week and they got moldy. I try not to judge and I didn't until he started acting incredibly rude. He interrupted me while I was greeting my next table. Instead of just waiting patiently like a normal human being he continued his interruption to ask for a refill. And when I explained him that the specialty drink he ordered doesn't come with free refills he bitched and moaned about it. When I brought him a water instead he complained that the specialty drink he ordered wasn't free refills and bitched about it for like 2 more minutes about it. I apologize loudly to the table next to him that I had been trying to greet. When his food came out he complained about the size of his 16 oz Ribeye and insisted it wasn't the right size. I confirmed that it was and ran away. When I checked on him he complained that his ribeye was flavorless bullshit . I offered to bring something to put on it like au jus or gravy or sauce or I could get him something else. It took me 5 minutes to get him to tell me he wanted something else. I finally almost lost my cool and just said \"What do you want me to do for you?!\" He ordered a New York strip instead. THEN he had the gall to act surprised when I took the ribeye away. Like he thought I was going to let him keep that steak for free and give him a new one. Sorry doesn't work that way. The manager brings out his new plate. I go to check on him and ask him if this steak is better. He kind of gives me a 'meh' and complains about the size. I explain to him that the New York strip only comes in 12 ounce so it's going to be smaller than the one he ordered earlier. At this point I'm convinced this fat slob had been banking on being able to keep both meals. He tips 2 on a 28 bill. BUT. The table next to this asshole the one that I was greeting when asshole interrupted me was the complete opposite. They were a young couple and very very polite. Their service passed without incident. I dropped their credit card receipts and thanked them and left them alone to go roll silverware so I could leave. These beautiful amazing human beings left me this note URL REMOVED with a hugely overly generous tip. I legit cried and I wish I had gone back to the table one more time to say thank you. If you are out there, Thank you so much. You are the people the make this job worth it.\n\n### Video Caption ###\nThe server responded to the customer's requests, communicating policy regarding refills and offering alternatives.

Despite the customer's behavior, the server attempted to accommodate the customer's requests and resolve the issues. The server handled this situation as professionally as they could. On the other hand, the server was interrupted while providing service to other customers and showed frustration during the process. However, a separate table of polite customers provided a generous tip and a note, demonstrating positive service.\n\n### 1-1. Video Evaluation Criteria Analysis\n**a) Reliability:** 3\n*   **Justification:** The server accurately confirmed the steak size initially. However, the customer was very difficult, and this made this item difficult to assess.\n\n**b) Responsiveness:** 4\n*   **Justification:** The server responded to the customer's complaints and requests and offered alternatives and solutions in a timely manner.\n\n**c) Assurance:** 3\n*   **Justification:** The server attempted to explain and accommodate the customer’s complaints and issues with the food. However, there was an obvious level of frustration in the dialogue.\n\n**d) Empathy:** 3\n*   **Justification:** While the server attempted to resolve issues and made an effort to provide service recovery, the server's frustration was apparent.\n\n**e) Tangibles:** 4\n*   **Justification:** This is impossible to determine from the scenario provided. However, the scenario provided does not show anything negative.\n\n### 1-2. Video Score Calculation\nVideo Score = (3 + 4 + 3 + 3 + 4) * 4 = 68\n\n### 5. Total Score\n**5-1. Total Score Calculation**\nTotal Score = 68\n\n### 6. Tip Calculation\n**6-1. Calculate the tip based on the total score and analysis.**\n*   **Service Level:** Considering the difficult customer situation, the video score, and the positive feedback from the other table, the service level is considered **Normal**.\n*   **Tipping Percentage:** The restaurant type is casual dining, and the country is the USA. Therefore, the tip range is 6-15%. Considering the mixed nature of the service, and the positive experience from the other table, the tip should be toward the upper end of the range.\n\n**6-2.

    "response": "Okay, I will analyze the video caption, evaluate the service, and calculate the tip.\n\n### Analysis of the Video Caption\n\nThe video caption describes a difficult situation where a large party, despite being told the restaurant couldn't accommodate them, showed up and caused service disruptions. The caption highlights customer actions and the challenging circumstances rather than server performance. Therefore, the evaluation will be based on what can be inferred and the limited information available.\n\n### 1-1. Video Evaluation Criteria\n\na) Reliability: 3. Mostly accurate orders, occasional lack of confirmation. The caption doesn't provide info on order accuracy. Since the situation caused service disruptions, it is assumed the order handling may have had challenges, but not necessarily server error.\n    *Justification:* The caption does not explicitly mention the server making order mistakes. The focus is on customer actions causing problems. However, the chaotic nature of the situation implies that things might not have been perfectly smooth.\n\nb) Responsiveness: 3. Average response speed, acceptable performance. The caption implies delays in service, like food taking a long time. However, this is attributed to circumstances not the server's inherent speed.\n    *Justification:* The caption notes issues with wait times. However, the root cause is attributed to the large party's size and actions, not directly to the server's speed.\n\nc) Assurance: 3. Can explain the menu but lacks confidence. The caption provides no insights on the server's menu knowledge and confidence.\n    *Justification:* Without information, the assumption is the server could likely explain the menu at a basic level but might have lacked the confidence to handle such a complex, high-pressure scenario effectively.\n\nd) Empathy: 3. Basic friendliness but lacks personalization. The caption does not focus on any empathy displayed by the server.\n    *Justification:* There is no mention of the server's empathy or personal connection. The focus is on the chaos, suggesting minimal personalization.\n\ne) Tangibles: 4. Uniform and table settings are tidy, cleanliness maintained. The caption doesn't mention anything that suggests the server's appearance or table cleanliness.\n    *Justification:* It can be assumed that the service was at least tidy.\n\n### 1-2.

However, there are subsequent issues due to the customer's unstated preferences (no sauce, white meat only, then an issue with the meat itself).

However, when the situation becomes difficult, the server involves the manager, showing the ability to handle the situation confidently.\n    d)  **Empathy:** 2 - Provides only minimal consideration.\n        *   **Justification:** The server deals with the customer's initial requests appropriately, but there is no indication of personalized service or empathy beyond the basic requirements of the job.

And tonight I snapped within earshot of guests I thought had left. \n\nLike I said it's been a really rough week and today was no better, crappy tippers, rude people, and managers and staff who won't do their job to help anyone out. Fast forward to 10:40, twenty to close. In walks a couple, who has to have that bread we give away. The hostess was mia so I go and ask them if I can help. They want to eat, so I ask if they just want some read to go. No we want some cheese sticks too. Ok, do you want the bar or the dining room? They want the bar, no sweat.\n\nCue the first issue, servers hanging out in the bar area talking about wanting to go home, no tables are going to come in this late and if they do, I'm not taking them. In front of my guests, now I know it sounds like I'm bashing servers, I'm not, I serve too. I'm bashing people inconsiderate of their co-workers. \n\nSecond issue, frozen drink machine is already broke down and clean. She wants a daiquiri. No biggie, put it back together and make her a drink. \n\nThird issue, bread is more like croutons. I go ahead and give it to them, go to the back, and there is no one to make bread, so I go scoop up a tray and put it in the oven, run back and tell the table that I've got some fresh coming. That since the baker was gone, I'm cooking it myself. \n\nSalads come out good, apps in record time, and all is well they are having a good time and I'm slowly falling further and further behind. \n\nCome time to get the bill, I realized I forgot to ring up the salads, fuck it. Drop the check the start laughing, nobody likes to be laughed at. Guess they thought it was funny apps and drinks came to 35 bucks.\n\nI left then to go cash out a server, five feet away, and they brought me their credit card. So I stopped what I was doing and took care of the guest.  Went back to my closing duties and taking care of the servers. \n\nWhen I finally look at their check, 2 on 35. I see her walking through the parking lot. I lost it talked some shit and balled up their credit slip and tossed it in the trash. With the statement, those bitches need it worse than me. Turn around and evidently he was just in the bathroom, heard everything. \n\nI'm pretty sure I'm fired come Monday. I train the new servers, that to not let any one tip upset them. I just let all the things build up, I can't take it anymore. I'm screwed.\n\nI'm at the bar, buddy is doing a successful job at getting me drunk. I hate life.\n\nTl;dr I cussed a customer after they were shits, turns out he was just in the bathroom. In my defense, it was almost an hour after close.",

It's been a week from hell. And tonight I snapped within earshot of guests I thought had left. Like I said it's been a really rough week and today was no better, crappy tippers, rude people, and managers and staff who won't do their job to help anyone out. Fast forward to 10:40, twenty to close. In walks a couple, who has to have that bread we give away. The hostess was mia so I go and ask them if I can help. They want to eat, so I ask if they just want some read to go. No we want some cheese sticks too. Ok, do you want the bar or the dining room? They want the bar, no sweat. Cue the first issue, servers hanging out in the bar area talking about wanting to go home, no tables are going to come in this late and if they do, I'm not taking them. In front of my guests, now I know it sounds like I'm bashing servers, I'm not, I serve too. I'm bashing people inconsiderate of their co workers. Second issue, frozen drink machine is already broke down and clean. She wants a daiquiri. No biggie, put it back together and make her a drink. Third issue, bread is more like croutons. I go ahead and give it to them, go to the back, and there is no one to make bread, so I go scoop up a tray and put it in the oven, run back and tell the table that I've got some fresh coming. That since the baker was gone, I'm cooking it myself. Salads come out good, apps in record time, and all is well they are having a good time and I'm slowly falling further and further behind. Come time to get the bill, I realized I forgot to ring up the salads, fuck it. Drop the check the start laughing, nobody likes to be laughed at. Guess they thought it was funny apps and drinks came to 35 bucks. I left then to go cash out a server, five feet away, and they brought me their credit card. So I stopped what I was doing and took care of the guest. Went back to my closing duties and taking care of the servers. When I finally look at their check, 2 on 35. I see her walking through the parking lot. I lost it talked some shit and balled up their credit slip and tossed it in the trash. With the statement, those bitches need it worse than me. Turn around and evidently he was just in the bathroom, heard everything. I'm pretty sure I'm fired come Monday. I train the new servers, that to not let any one tip upset them. I just let all the things build up, I can't take it anymore. I'm screwed. I'm at the bar, buddy is doing a successful job at getting me drunk. I hate life. Tl;dr I cussed a customer after they were shits, turns out he was just in the bathroom. In my defense, it was almost an hour after close.\n\n### Video Caption ###\nThe server proactively initiated service due to a missing colleague, fixed a broken drink machine, and personally baked replacement bread for a quality issue.

Video Evaluation Criteria**\n\n*   **a) Reliability:** 3\n    *   **Justification:** The server made a significant mistake by forgetting to ring up the salads, which is a clear error. However, the server took the initiative in multiple areas to provide good service and fix issues, so this is a balancing act, so it's mostly accurate orders.\n*   **b) Responsiveness:** 4\n    *   **Justification:** The server immediately addressed the customer's needs and handled issues like the broken drink machine and bread quality.\n*   **c) Assurance:** 4\n    *   **Justification:** The server took control of the situation and solved issues that were present by fixing a broken drink machine, and baking bread, which shows confidence and initiative.\n*   **d) Empathy:** 2\n    *   **Justification:** The server seems to be empathetic to the customer's situation but clearly not, especially with the ending of the story, and some words are used that are rude.\n*   **e) Tangibles:** 4\n    *   **Justification:** While not directly addressed, the server ensured everything was handled to the best of his ability.\n\n**1-2. Video Score Calculation**\n\n*   Video Score = (3 + 4 + 4 + 2 + 4) \\* 4 = 68\n\n**5. Total Score**\n\n*   **5-1. Total Score Calculation**\n    *   Total Score = Video Score = 68\n\n**6. Tip Calculation**\n\n*   **6-1. Calculate the tip based on the total score and analysis.**\n    *   The server made an error by forgetting to ring up the salads and cussed at a customer. The behavior is unprofessional.\n    *   Since the restaurant is a casual dining establishment in the USA.\n    *   The service level is considered \"Poor\" due to the mistakes and unprofessional behavior, with a Reddit post and user input showing a negative customer experience.\n*   **6-2. Format**\n    *   Since there were serious issues, the tip must be set to 0%.\n\n###Output indicator###\n```json\n{\n  \"### Video Caption i(th) ###\": \"The server proactively initiated service due to a missing colleague, fixed a broken drink machine, and personally baked replacement bread for a quality issue.
